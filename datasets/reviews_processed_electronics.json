Rand McNally, are you listening?First thing I did after charging it was connect it to my laptop and install the software and then attempt to update it.  The software detected a problem with my update and wanted my home address so I could be sent a patch on an SD card.  Hello?  I don't think I'm all that unusual; my home address is a PO box that a friend checks weekly and that I might get to check every six months or so.  I live in my truck and at truck stops.  If you need to make a patch available on an SD card then you should send the SD cards to the truck stops where the devices are sold.  I ran the update program multiple times until the program said that the TND 700 was completely updated.I programmed in the height (13'6\"), the length (53') and the weight (80,000#) of my rig and told it that I preferred highways.  I was parked at a truck stop in the Cincinnati OH area.  My next pickup was about 15 miles down the same freeway but on the other side of it a couple of blocks.  My cell phone GPS (Sprint) said to get on the freeway to get to my pickup.  The TND 700 routed me thru 23 miles of residential streets before finally getting me to my pickup.  Very exciting, especially since every time I refused to turn down a street posted \"No Trucks\" the TND 700 took almost 5 minutes to figure a re-route, and it happened multiple times on that short trip.I decided to give it another chance.  After my pickup on the north side of Cincinnati just off of I-75 I needed to head to Phoenix AZ via I-71.  Easy route is to just hop on I-75 and drive west and south to the intersection of I-71.  Indeed, that is what my cell phone advised.  The TND 700, however, wanted to route me over surface streets across the city and pick up I-75 on the other side of the city.  I turned it off and the next time I passed a truck stop of the same chain I purchased it at I returned it and got my money back.I then spent $30 on a cheap printer.

I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI'sTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I'll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.pros:Large screenterrific imagesoutstanding volumecons:inability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and viasa somewhat outdated POI information.Non-truck specific routings.Cost.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "1st impression", "unixReviewTime": 1283990400, "reviewTime": "09 9, 2010"}

I've driven well over 1-mil miles and done most of my own routing so I pretty know whats the fastest and shortest. Have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with ANY Gps unit they'll ALL get you in trouble if you let them. I was really excited about this unit, due to the size and the features. Allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull. But the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking. I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn't make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. Here I'm sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn't make me happy. This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. Twice it put me under 12'6\" bridges when I'm 13'6\". Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally. All in all I expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot. It just had to many route mistakes. Going back to the basic garmin.

I installed it in less than 1/2 hour and am very happy with the results.PROS:-Comes with all of the hardware you'll need-Comes with some extra hardware of which I have NO IDEA what it is there for.  I suspect it's a 'universal' hardware pack for several models and not all hardware is used for all models, but it's nice to have a little 'extra' (which is always better than not enough!)-The included Level is nice... well it's cheap but it works!-The instructions did a decent enough job of explaining how to install the unit.CONS:-Metal is just a tad on the flimsy side.  I have no problems trusting it with my &lt;30lb television but if I were to mount something closer to its maximum rated weight of 55lbs, I think I would be quite a bit nervous about it holding up.-The holes in the base were just a little bit too wide for my wall stud.  I think the particular stud I was installing it onto was a typical 2X4 and if centered, the left and right side holes were just a little too far to grab both sides of the stud.  I had to reposition it so that the center holes were aligned to the left side of the stud, and that the right side holes were aligned to the right side of the stud.  As a result, I was only able to install four of the six bolts to hold it in place, but I don't feel it will be an issue with my 28LB television.  If your house uses wider studs this probably wouldn't even be an issue.-The metal does sag just a little bit with the weight of the television on it.  I mounted the base just a little bit \"off level\" to help compensate for this, and had no problems getting the television level using the adjustments available to me.CONCLUSION:  All in all It's not a bad unit.. ESPECIALLY for the price.  Yes I would have liked to see a sturdier unit, but when you take into account the &lt;$30 price tag, it's an excellent bargain.  I don't think I'll have any issue with a static mounting of my TV in the corner of the bedroom *BUT* if you are considering installing this unit for a television that will see a lot of traffic, constant repositioning, etc... then you might want to spend more money on something sturdier.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It works!", "unixReviewTime": 1306800000, "reviewTime": "05 31, 2011"}

I will say that the hinges can be a bit tight, and it's not designed to be easily adjustable on the fly (you'll need a few tools).  If you plan on swinging your TV around a lot, this might not be the best choice, but it works perfectly fine if you only need to adjust it every now and then.  My favorite part is the small base.  I didn't have a lot of wall space to mount a TV, and this met my needs without eating all my money.  Keep in mind that you'll want at least two people to mount the TV on this device.  I attached my TV alone by precariously balancing it on a stack of boxes while I inserted the screws.

That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud.

Let me start off by saying it works as advertised.  But that won't get you 5 stars.  The problem is installation.  Maybe it's my own fault for thinking all TV wall mounts worked like the Peerless I had.  See, that one has a separate TV plate that you screw to the TV first.  Then you have the second piece (the actual wall mount) that you screw to the wall.  Once that's done, using the bracket mounted on the TV, you hang the TV on the wall mount and secure it with a single bolt.  One person can easily put a TV on the wall.Not so much with this one.  Yes, I will admit that once it's mounted, it's a more secure connection, but it's the mounting that's the problem.  You can't do it alone.  Depending on the weight of the TV, you will need at least one helper.  This mount is one piece, which means that you have to hold the TV to the wall-mounted plate while attaching it with screws.  That can get tricky, especially with heavier TVs (I used it for a while with my old LCD TV which weighs 40+ pounds).  They do get kudos for providing all the screws for all VESA types as well as a regular and an Allen wrench.Three stars for ease of installation, five stars for usability, for a combined four stars.

I looked at another mount by the same company but it did not articulate so I was worried I wouldn't be able to achieve the viewing angles that I needed. So I found this one & went w/ it based on the high reviews. I could not be more pleased.1) PRICE - If you were to go to the big electronics store (BB) or the big box monster (WM) you would pay hundreds. I can't fathom those more expensive mounts doing anything that this one does not. Does it cook dinner for me? Why pay $100-$250 for a mount when you can get this one for $29.99 & oh, by the way have the confidence in 898 customer reviews averaging 4.5 stars at the time of this writing?2) FUNCTION - This mount is solid. It articulates to the left, to the right. It pans, it tilts. One small negative.....the plastic clips for routing wires are nearly useless. I took them off.3) WHATS IN THE BOX - Normally I would not comment on what an item comes with but in this case I was so impressed I felt it was worth mentioning. It comes w/ everything you need in neatly sealed and labeled plastic sleeves. It comes w/ lag bolts that everyone will use to mount to the wall stud. (mounting to a wall stud is required unless you are mounting to concrete) Then it has 9 different screw sets to mount the plate to the back of your TV. It has 2 washer sets for the mounting plate (based on if your TV has a flat or curved back). Then it has a spanner wrench for tightening the screw of the mounting plate. Then it also has 2 plastic anchors for mounting to a concrete wall. Last but not least are the VESA adaptors (which I did not need)4) WHAT YOU NEED THAT ISN'T INCLUDED -  Pencil / Level / Stud finder / Phillips screwdriver / Drill w/ a 7/32 drill bit / Socket wrench w/ a 13mm attachment.5) CONCLUSION - This is a no brainer.

I did this because the Sony is an older model TV and weighs a little over 50lbs (which is still within this mounts rating) and the Vizio only weights 23lbs.  I have a Sanus extended articulating mount that I bought a few years ago and paid over $100 dollars for it.

Is it the same quality as the Sanus? No, but it has enough quality to perform its advertised claims.  I saw some reviews on here complaining about mount sag after install.  Now this is based on the 23 lb TV, but I'm not experiencing this problem.  The mount has 4 pivot points and after installation, ALL need to be tightened to the point that movement is allowed with intentional moderate force.  Out of the box, this mount would have sagged like others complained, but I'm guessing its left slightly loose to help ease the installation process.I won't hesitate to buy another one in the future if the need arises.  An excellent price ($30) for a good quality mount.  If you want a mount that you can do pull ups on after install, buy the Sanus (and pay 5x more to do it).

Unfortunately, the arm was welded to the wall bracket at a slight angle, meaning that regardless of how it would mount it and the LCD would never be level.Also, the powder coating near one of the bolts had come off and I could see some rust already forming.I decided to see if the mount would be the right fit for the tv before returning, figuring I would just get a replacement and hope for the best. I'm glad I did because this led me to find two other issues.The first one I blame on the manufacturers, the second I would consider a design flaw of the LG lcd.The first issue is that the screws supplied to attach the bracket to the tv are too few and two short. The screws are only 12mm long, and would barely catch in the threads of the TV if they weren't recessed at all. Most mounting threads on lcds and plasmas are partially recessed. I stopped by my local Lowes and picked up two packs of similar screws (M4-70 or something to that affect). $0.80 a packet so not much of an expenditure, just a big hassle. I needed 20mm long screws to mount this to the tv, so a pretty fair difference over what was supplied. The manufacturer supplies several different thread and gauge options, but only one shallow length of each set.The second issue is that this universal mount covered the power and HDMI ports on the back of the 26le5300. Again, I think this is more of an issue with the tv then the mount, as they're situated rather high and central. Either way, it's something you'll want to check on your tv before ordering this product.I actually returned this and in its stead purchased a similar mount from the same company. TheVideoSecu Swing LCD Wall Mount 20 inch Extension 55 lb loading capacity for LCD TV Monitor Flat Screen VESA 75mm/100 mm 1USgets very high marks from me. It's basically the same arm with a 75x75 to 100x100 VESA head on it. This second arm did not have any of the manufacturing errors of the previous model and fit the back of my tv perfectly.I understand that it's a very affordable mount, and that most of my issues may have been resolved with a replacement.

Both are bargains when purchased at the discounted price Barnes & Noble provides to its members.However, they are designed for reading...if you want a gaming tablet, a Skype video tablet, or need access to thousands of apps, you need an I-Pad.I have owned a \"Brand X\" color e-reader for about a year, but seldom use it for reading because it causes eye strain. I have a Nook Simple Touch e-reader that is wonderful for books, but its e-ink screen is black on white only, which does not work well for colorful magazines such as \"Automobile\" or \"National Geographic\".Barnes & Noble has an offer that enables its members to buy the Nook tablet for MUCH less than the price quoted by internet vendors, so I took advantage of their offer...plus the staff of my neighborhood Barnes & Noble were very helpful, and invited me to classes they provide to teach new owners the in's and out's of their new tablet. Mine is the 8gb version, which works as well as the 16gb version. I added a 32gb memory card, so my Nook has more storage for books than I could ever fill.The Nook Tablet is the best of both worlds. It is easy on the eyes for long reading sessions because its screen was designed to prevent eye strain. The fonts are very clear, very sharp, and have very high contrast, enabling you to read with the screen set at a very low brightness level, eliminating eye strain. Independent tests have verified that the Nook tablet has less reflection and glare than any color e-reader or color tablet, because the screen's glass cover is bonded directly to the LCD, eliminated the air gap that causes glare.The vivid color makes magazines \"pop\" even more than their paper versions. Barnes & Noble adds a special \"text only\" option for magazine articles that make it easy to read the text by enlarging the fonts and putting the text of the article in a single long file.The Nook \"shop\" does not work as well as the Nook website on the internet for searching for specific books or categories of books. So, I downloaded the Dolphin HD browser from the Nook shop and use it to look at the Nook shop's book inventory. The Dolphin browser uses tabs, so I can put two or three books I am considering in their own tab, and switch back and forth.The Nook Tablet has Pandora Radio installed, so I can listen to my favorite music while I read books. The sound is weak through the Nook tablet's puny speaker, but wonderful through good earbuds. I also transferred about fifty of my favorite CD's to the Nook's memory card, so I can listen to music even when I am not near an internet connection.When I get tired of reading, the Nook tablet lets me watch movies and tv shows on Netflix or TV.Com. Movies on Netflix look wonderful, because the color balance on the Nook tablet is superior to that of any seven inch tablet currently available. Skin tones are difficult to get \"right\", but the Nook tablet does a great job.Many reviewers make the error of comparing the Nook Tablet to full-blown tablets, such as the Apple I-Pad. The Nook Tablet is designed to be an e-reader, and for that purpose, it is superior to any of its seven inch competition. The fact that it includes Pandora Radio and Netflix is a bonus...but it IS an e-reader. The Nook Shop has a relatively small number of apps, each of which has been tested to verify it works well with the Nook tablet's seven inch screen...most Android apps are designed for a three inch or four inch screen.The reading apps for children are impressive. Last week I downloaded a free children's book that combined the best of the \"book world\" and the \"video world\". The book played music in the background...as a character walked through a field, the flowers were swaying in the wind. The book provided an option to have a character read the book out loud, and an option to turn the voice off, so your child can read the book to herself. Many of the children's reading apps are free, or cost less than $5, a bargain compared with the $15 or $20 children's books sell for in stores.The Nook website offers a \"book of the day\" for adults and a \"book of the day\" for children. The illustrations in the children's books take advantage of the Nook's color screen. Yesterday's children's book was \"Mary Poppins\", a bargain for $2...but the REAL Mary Poppins seems a bit scary compared with the Julie Andrew's Disney version.For people who want MORE than just the world's best e-reader, Amazon.com sells a $35 SD card that converts the Nook Tablet into a conventional Android tablet with full access to Google Play and its vast array of Android apps. Just put the N2A card into the Nook's card slot, and restart the Nook. When you want to use it as just an e-reader, take the N2A card back out.

As a result, what you get is pretty limited.It's a fairly sturdy device by feel, and not difficult to hold for a while and use. The quality of the screen is pretty good and it's not difficult to read for extended periods of time (so long as you're not out in the sun anyway, almost all LCD screens perform poorly there).Very little of the space on the device is available for sideloaded content by default, so you need to use microsd cards to add more if you want to do too much with that.You can sideload content from any source that uses Adobe DRM for epubs, and also epubs that don't have DRM at all. This means that getting ebooks from the library is pretty simple. You can install an Overdrive app and do it directly without going through a computer if your library uses overdrive.You can root it to get access to more apps. If you want to run a more pure version of Android, you can go for either putting together a Cyanogenmod card yourself or purchase one already made from Nook2Android.B&N; gives away a book and an app every Friday on their blog, so that's worth checking in on regularly.On the whole, this is an okay device for reading and can be a kind of nice semi-tablet to give to someone who normally tends to load their computers/tablets up with viruses by being carelessness. It's locked-down state works in your favor from that perspective.For more general tablet use, this is a pretty poor choice.

Chaika \"book, movie, tech lover\"", "helpful": [17, 19], "reviewText": "Months later, I am still happy with this Tablet, but you should know 2 things. One is, you'll get it for $224 if you're a B&N; member.  Also, if you go online, often they have a deal such that if you buy a year's subscription to the NY Times, they reduce the price of the Tablet.  To get the member's discount, you're better off going to a B&N; store.  BUT THE BIG THING is, if you already own Kindle books, Barnes and Noble stupidly don't provide a Kindle app, HOWEVER, you can buy the cheapest n2a card, either on Amazon or on n2a.com.  This allows you to boot your Tablet up as a full Android tablet (like the $500 ones), and you can get the Kindle app on that.  There's no problem accessing your Kindle books on the Nook.  Since, as noted below, the Nook eReader is beautifully designed, much better in my opinion than any Kindle, so I use my n2a card only when I'm reading a Kindle book.  I find B%N and Amazon charge about the same for books. There are some books on Nook that Kindle doesn't have, and some on Kindle that Nook doesn't have.  However, only Nook has the Page Perfect editions and the Enhanced editions of books with embedded video, audio clips, and animations.One other thing: the Nook has a tab for \"My Stuff\" so you can download music, pictures, videos and documents easily onto the Nook. You don't have to buy music for it.  Use what's on your PC or what you rip from disk. I am doing a project of editing and making slide shows of over 4,000 pictures.  For that, I bought a 32 disk san drive for the Nook to download the pictures to and to work on them using a Nook app.  I don't know how you could do that on the 8 gig Fire. I don't know if you can put pictures on the Cloud for the Fire.  However, I can make many different slide shows and digital albums on the Nook Tablet without any Cloud.I got this and the Kindle Fire on November 16, 2012.  Then came days of comparing them side by side.  You can see my review of the Fire on its page's customer reviews, so, how about the Nook?  First of all, if you want one, get it from Barnes and Noble. It cost $199 with a year's subscription to the NY Times.  Even without that discount, it costs $249 with free shipping (and, this month the NOOKcolor Tablet is only $149!)Hands down, for the money there is no finer Tablet than this Nook.  Some reviewers say they're going to get a Sony or a Galaxy for their features. I have no quarrel with that, but you pay for those features.  Sony and Galaxy are fine tablets--I've tried them out, too.  However, the Sony is on sale for $399.99 this month, and the 32 bit is on sale for $499.99.  Comparing it side by side with the Nook, the Sony salesperson said, \"Wow! it's as good as the Sony!\"  Yes, and for about the half the price.Another salesman lamented that the Sony doesn't have the Netflix app, which comes with the Nook. Of course, Sony wants you to buy their movies.  Barnes & Noble just wants you to buy their books, which is fine for a Bookaholic like me.  B&N; has 2,500,000 titles available, over 1,000,000 free.  Since they have a lot of earlier editions of books, Book Freaks like me can purchase those or get them free.  They even have a Page Perfect series which are facsimiles of beautifully designed books. What you see on your screen is what a reader in 1867 or 2007 saw, brilliantly illustrated and unusually printed books.  You'd pay a fortune for them in their original editions, not $3.99. Many children's classics are in this series, but also adult books, like Butterflies.The Nook also has Enhanced Editions with audio and video clips embedded in the text.  Some of the old books are also Enhanced.  Changes because of misprints or other errors in the original are underlined.  You touch them, and can see what the original had. One of my Nook Books is a collection of Kafka.  You touch underlined passages and up pops a picture of the street Kafka has mentioned, or of a notable person he's alluded to.  In general, eBooks are superior to paper if they are on a Tablet with access to the Web.  You read in more depth, and can envision what the author is writing about without interrupting your reading experience. The Nook's connection to the Web is as fast as your wifi and is accessible with two clicks: Look up and Google (or Wikipedia).The Nook comes with Pandora and you can also download music from your computer using the USB cord which comes with the Nook.  Pictures, videos and documents can all be downloaded to the Nook, which has built-in folders for each, and, if the 16 Gig iof the Tablet is  not enough for you, you  can put a 32 Gig or smaller SD card.That's not all!  If you're App happy, you  can buy the N2A card for the Nook Tablet, which gives you every App in the Android Marketplace without rooting it and voiding the warranty.  I myself have been happy so far with the thousand or more apps available for the Nook, with new ones being added each week.  Truthfully, if it's apps that are what you want most in a tablet, the way to go is the iPad--for $600-$700 at the least.I gave my granddaughter a Nook Tablet.  Many of her friends have iPads; however, she says, she can get the same apps as her friends do. Using the Drawing app, she designed her birthday party invites on her Nook and then emailed them also using her Nook eMail.  She says she prefers Angry Birds on the Nook.  I can't comment. Angry Birds don't tempt me, but I do play some games on my  Nook.The Nooks have no cameras or Face Time, but with the money you save by buying the Nook, you can get an iPhone which does  have both.  If you want features like that in a Tablet, it costs $500 or more plus monthly data fees. No data fees with the Nook, of course, although you can browse the Web with ease and speed, depending on your router.You can stream movies and TV stories with ease on the Nook.  The picture quality is excellent if your wifi is.  I'm in a rural area with no 4G, but I still get crisp, clear movies with my wifi device.  Apps standard on the Nook are Hulu, Smithsonian, Showtime, and Netflix.  There may be more sources of flicks on it, but, truthfully, I haven't looked--and, since they add apps every week, you have to keep looking.If, like me, your primary use for a Tablet is reading, the Nook is tops.  Their eReader is elegantly designed and beautifully intuitive.  It even tells you how many pages are left in the chapter you'e on.  Notice, it displays page numbers, not \"locations\" like the Fire.  If you can't remember  who a character is, put your finger lightly on the name. 5 popups show instantly.  Touch Find, and in a second you have a page which lists every page that word has been on, complete with it sentence. (You can do this with place names as well.)  The other choices are Highlight, Note, Share, Look Up.  The Share lets you highlight a passage and send it to your Contacts--not social networking sites.  For those, you use the Share option in the menu at the bottom of the screen.  My friends tell me they love getting these passages from me.  Of course, I choose those  that are witty or relevant to a discussion we've had.  Other reading options are Go to Page, Back, Find (for when you want to type in the search screen), Contents, Text options, Brightness and Discover.  This last shows you other books on the subject you're reading about or by the same author.In short, as an eReader, the Nook is tops. As a Tablet, it does well, although not as well as those that are way more expensive.  Actually, everything it does do, it does very well.  It just doesn't have certain features--but that is true of every Tablet I've seen except the iPad.  As of now, the iPad's picture quality is not as good as the Nook's or, for that matter, the Fire's.  The iPad3 will have hi def, however.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Outstanding 7\" Tablet", "unixReviewTime": 1329350400, "reviewTime": "02 16, 2012"}

It does the jobs well until now. I personally like it very much for its excellent hardware performance. With low price, fast response, and light weight, book size, and Barn and Nobles support, It is the best device for children when you want to have something as an alternative for your computer.I am a fan of Amazon.com and meant to buy a kindle for my children. but the displayed sample on my local Bestbuy store showed me that the nook tablet responded much faster than kindle fire. It could not be generally true, but based on the displayed tablets, I had to choose the nook.Until now, I have had mainly happy experiences with it. It has apps for children, one of them has many Smithsonian videos that my small children love the most. My college age child also use it to check email at home because it responds in second to wake up, and we do not have to turn it off for many days before it runs slow. After you turn it off and restart it (hold the power button for seconds for on and off), it become fast again.I just found last day it has a recipe App with more than 17,000 recipes. It has pictures for most of the products.My children have asked me to buy the istory app for 3.99 dollars, but it contends 24 or more story books for children that it reads to my children. Wonderful! The American history app is excellent too, It costs me 1 dollar or so (not remember exactly now).Problems: It did start after my children left it idled for hours while a game was running. After the battery was charged for a whole night, it still refused to start. When I tried again in the afternoon, it started but took more than 10 minutes. I guess the software was damaged and repaired. It is now as good as it was before. I am still wondering what was wrong with it.It is not a computer and can not be connected to TV. only one or two of my children can use it in the same time. We still have to use computers when we want to enjoy movies or photos together.It was designed for you to buy their books. but I think the prices of most books are not low enough for me to purchase e version. I would rather buy some hard copies instead. However, one of my children loves the classical books which are free or only one dollar each. She is happy with the books.As a summary, the machine is excellent, sturdy, fast, and convenient for emails and web browsing. The books are not priced low enough for me to purchase although there are some old free books. Apps for children are wonderful.

I'd cancelled my order for as many Kindle Fires because I felt the technical specs justified the extra $50 for the Nook Tablet.  I also appreciated more onboard storage and expandability since we're a four person family and I drive ... all three were for my wife and kids and not me, and I expected they'd be used on the road a lot.I think that by the time anyone reads this they should know that the tablets (both Kindle and Nook, to be fair) are tied to their respective distributors.  That didn't come as any surprise to me, I fully expected it.  I knew that, without modifying the device (not really acceptable for your average person, if you ask me), I would be stuck with B&N;'s app store.  What I didn't know was how woefully limited that app store really is; it pales in comparison to Amazon's and doesn't even register when compared to the android marketplace.My daughter got hers first (a late birthday present).  For the most part, she was satisfied with it.  I made sure wifi was available throughout the house; we downloaded a couple of apps (Angry Birds, of course, and a drawing program).  The first thing to notice is that the B&N; app store has a tiny selection of free apps.  The ad-sponsored version of Angry Birds can't be found, but for a couple of bucks I didn't mind paying - I paid for the non-ad version for my phone, too.Netflix works as well on the tablet as it does on any other device in my home (PS3 and a bluray player, both hardwired networking) as long as wifi connection is good.  Her other use was email, and since she hardly gets any, the built in app was OK.The other two tablets I purchased were for Christmas for my wife and son, and that's where the problems started.  My wife gets copious amounts of email from several different accounts and likes to keep it as neat as possible... she also uses her smartphone and computer and doesn't want to have to delete things three times.  The built in email application absolutely sucks.  You can't even empty the trash to completely delete messages you don't want.  We experienced this on our phones and installed the highest rated email app we could find on the android marketplace, which also happened to be a FREE app.  B&N; makes nothing by distributing free apps in their marketplace, so this app was not available at all, and the selection was slim for other apps.  Even the touchpad app that people were using to syncronize with Microsoft Exchange servers apparently doesn't work (and is very expensive for an app).As I mentioned, I knew I'd be limited to B&N; app store - I just didn't realize how limited that app store was.My wife then started getting a bunch of free samples of books, and bought several of them.  They all downloaded except one stubborn one.  That book would load just fine on all the other Nooks in our house (the other two Tablets and we have two original Nooks, as well).  I sent an email to technical support and received the usual \"we got your request and will reply as soon as possible\" message, along with the addition that they are experiencing a high volume of help requests.  That was a week ago and we still have not heard back.  After a few days, though, we physically took the Nook to the store to get help.  Nothing worked; off/on, archive/unarchive, even de and re-registered the device (losing our wifi and email configs in the process).  This book still will not load.We finally \"side loaded\" the book, which required installing a program on my wife's PC (which is very annoying in itself) and we were required to create an Adobe ID (how much spam will we get from them, I wonder?).  After side-loading the book, it has no cover art... more annoyance.  That book still won't download correctly, even after they told us it'd be fixed in 48 hours (that was five days ago).I am not one to \"root\" products like these (especially since they aren't \"mine,\" as I won't be the one using them).  As the \"guy,\" it seems I'm responsible for all technical support in the house and didn't want to deal with the ramifications (or, frankly, even take the time to run through all those steps to do it).  It's not that I can't, it's that it's a pain in the buttocks and I simply shouldn't have to.  We were not asking for the world, we were asking for a table that had Nook e-reader software and allowed a few other niceties.  I wasn't expecting an iPad for $250, but I was expecting working software and a functional email program.It's technically not a bad tablet - the screen is bright and clear and responsive; the UI is decent (although I prefer the four buttons on my android phone over the single big \"n\" button on the Nook).  It's solidly built and sturdy; with Angry Birds and Netflix as my only benchmarks I can say they both run much better than they do on my phone, with no pauses (that I saw) in Angry Birds at all.However, the accumulation of annoyances was a bit too much for me (let's say there was a nagging voice coming from somewhere... the other side of the bed).  I am returning all three - luckily B&N; has a holiday policy that will allow me to return them, which is very cool of them.  They have not lost me as a customer; I have my books purchased from them and will continue to buy.I hope them the best in the future; it was a nice try.  If they just weren't so tight fisted about control over content (especially apps, in this case) I'd have stuck with it.  Technically speaking, the device is quite good and, at the current time, IMO, the hardware is worth the price tag.  I wouldn't mind being limited to the B&N; app store if they actually offered more apps... a LOT more, as they have practically nothing compared to what's available for the android community at large.  Again, I'm not asking for an iPad; I know the iPad can do some really cools things this Tablet can't, just something to make the \"tablet\" part of the Nook Tablet more worthwhile.I imagine they'll fix glitches with the download problem, too.  I'm not the only person who had a problem, but I think everyone else managed to find a solution (besides side-loading).  Keep in mind I generally know what I'm doing and tried everything, and the \"expert\" at the brick-and-mortar store couldn't fix it, either.  The lady from Glee didn't come out and entertain us while they fixed our tablet, either... that was disappointing.So that's my review - it's decent hardware hamstrung by a few bugs and tight fisted control over content.  Some will argue that it's not meant to be a tablet, it's meant to be an e-reader, but let's be honest - it's marketed as a tablet; it's called the Nook TABLET.  It doesn't have to be an iPad, but it should work a lot better than it does at being a tablet.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "People shouldn't be surprised about what it is, but still disappointing.", "unixReviewTime": 1325635200, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2012"}

The people at Walmart didn't want you near them, and didn't know ANYTHING about them. Best Buy was pretty much the same, except you could 'sorta' test them out. BN though had people trained to know EVERYTHING about them, even the stuff that was not listed about them on the BN website.First thing not listed: if the Nook Colour can do it, so can the Nook Tablet. (for instance... read .cbz files without installing any extra apps)The 16gb model was much more responsive than the 8gb, so to me it was well worth the extra 50 bucks.Add to that that currently if you buy one at BN and don't like it, you have 2 weeks to return it for a full refund as long as it is still in new condition (so no attempting to root the device, which from what the rep told me will brick it unlike the Colour)that pretty much sold me, I found a place with micro SD cards on sale, bought a few, and took my Nook home.Pros:The screen is AWESOME! I use it for reading .cbz comics and .pdf files more than anything. The missing gap between the glass and screen made reading much better. Also the response on the touch screen was great.much better response time at turning pages, launching apps and using the inet that other tablets in the budget rangenative flash supportnative .cbz support (main reason I bought it)supports almost every popular ebook format except for .mobi (which can be converted to epub or .pdf anyway)good size for holding one handed for reading and lightweight (under a pound)battery life... 11 hours+ with wifi off, 8+ with it on, I tried it out and watched lots of movies and did some reading on it without it coming close to dying on me.a test drive opportunity if you buy it at BN and dont scratch it up or anything. I like the idea that I was able to take it home and so if it actually does everything that I want it to do wihtout a fear that I'm stuck with it for good.also if you buy it from BN you can buy an 'oops' return warranty (which means if you spill coffee on it or drop it, it can be replaced)affordable if you go without things like eating out 2x a week for awhileCons:lack of Android Market, lack of some apps I would like to see on the BN market (such as Google Music app) no sideloading apps at the moment either. That being said, this also means that apps available from BN will actually work with your Nook, there isnt a quantity over quality in the app store either. This means that if you've bought an app from Android market, you will have to buy it again if you want to use it on the Nook.The screen. trust me, I love it. But unlike other tablets where if you crack the glass you just have to replace the glass, on the Nook if you crack it, the screen is toastno front facing camera (or any camera for that matter). The ability to use Skype would have been nice, but wasn't a complete necessity. I've had many friends with tablets that had a camera that swear they never used it even once, and thinking about it, I wuld seldom use it either since most places outsite of my house that I will use it are places where video chatting would be frowned on, like Starbucks or the libraryno bluetooth, which to me didn't matter, but it seems to be an issue for some people. There IS bluetooth, but it's disabled and there isn't a way to enable itno GPS, this would be nice, unlike bluetooth, I would actually use it.mono speaker instead of stereo, again seems to be an issue for other people, I plug it into the minijack on my surround sound at home or the jack in my car stereo when I'm on the road though and its just fine. I use headphones if I'm out and about. Why on earth would I care about speakers that I never use anyway?no .flac support. a good chunk of my digital music now is .flac. it does have .ogg support thoughno .avi support. again, a massive portion of my movies etc are all in .avi format. It does have .mkv and .mp4 support though, so from here on out I will just have to rip my video files in those formats if I plan on watching them on it.lack of decent accessories selection. lets face it, the case market seems to be geared toward people that worship at the church of Steve, and the availability of accessories shows it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "GREAT .cbz (comic file) reader an more!", "unixReviewTime": 1330300800, "reviewTime": "02 27, 2012"}

I suspect they didn't but this would be something to check on if considering purchasing.If you want a tablet for web browsing, checking email, ebooks, video, and many other apps and this is as much as you want to spend, then it isn't a bad deal. I would recommend paying more for the newer version--the Nook HD. (They also make a version with a larger screen, the HD+)Also note that there are third party programs available which will allow you to boot a rooted Android system off of an SD card. This will give more options but I found the original Nook Tablet to be sluggish running off such a card--possibly because I also went to Jelly Bean and this might have been too much for the older tablet. I wound up going back to running the rooted software directly off the tablet (but rooting is more work than inserting a card).

Only has a 1024 x 600 pixel screen but from a foot away you can't tell the different between this and a device with 1200 x 800 pixels or more. Reading is a pleasure. I've had all the Kindles and all the Nooks and for the best overall reading experience the Nook is better.Why? The Nook devices feel great to hold. The plastics are soft, all the buttons are in good places, and recharging takes no time at all. Also, the software layout and navigation is easy and logical. Next, the font choices, sizes, and other personalizations are all useful. And finally, no freaking ads. You can personalize your home screen and on the Nook Touch you can select your own photos for the screen saver.What's my problem then with Kindle? Couple things. The ads of course. Also, I personally don't care for the software. You are stuck in their software with no way to personalize it. Boring! Also, the buttons are in bad places so you can accidentally shut the device off. On the lower priced Kindles the font choices are fewer and the smaller size choices are useless unless you use a magnifying glass. And the devices aren't as nice to hold. At least on the Fires they took the idea from Nook on making the backs have a soft plastic.I'm pretty sure that anyone who takes the time to try both Nook and Kindle will like the Nook better. As reading devices go they just make more sense. As far as a full fledged tablet goes you'll have to look to Apple or Samsung in my opinion.

I've got to say, it's nice.  Fonts are small, though one could choose dpi if they had visual issues (google this).  Netflix works, and the UI is really quite nice - pretty much no need for Button Savior, battery life is same as CM7.  In general I like it better than CM7.  My major hardware dislikes are headphone jack requires a little wiggling sometimes, no BT, no GPS.  Seems to charge fine with a normal cable.At this point I lean toward Samsung tablets - I like the IR and the microSD slot.===========================Update Jul 2012: I've installed Cyanogen 7, which works with button savior.  I had trouble installing from .zip booting into recovery but was able to install without a hitch using a bootable microSD card.  Fonts are sometimes a bit big, as is line spacing, but in general, CM7 frees you of the B&N; walled-ness, even as somewhat mitigated below.  Netflix doesn't work, and Google Chrome won't run on Android 2.3.  Headphone jack a bit intermittent - need to wiggle wire sometimes.===========================Original review, Dec. 2011.===========================First I give a summary, followed by the details if U are interested.  I hope people will read reviews here, as, if you say much at all on B&N;'s site, they don't post your review and don't allow you to modify it so that U can post it!:A Nook Tablet could be quite good if you only want to:-  Read ebooks purchased from B&N;-  Browse the web on a tablet-  Play a small selection of games, having to pay 3-4X normal Android/Apple pricesGet something else or modify it if U want to:-  Buy a full selection of games/apps-  Pay the same price for a game as U would on an iPhone/iPad, Android Phone buying from either the Android Marketplace or Amazon App Store.-  Play music where U can sort by artist, album, genre, etc.-  Play mpeg videos-  Watch YouTubeIf U are willing to do a bit of work, you can do all this by modifying the device.  I used it rooted with the modifications described below for 11 months, before installing Cyanogen 7.2 on it.  This is a huge improvement over rooted with the below modifications - it's essentially a normal 7\" Android tablet now.The Details:============My daughter got a Nook Tablet for Christmas 2011.  She'd been saving for an iPad (~$500) but at the rate she was saving, we took pity after a year and a half.While she does read (and so do us parents), she also wanted to use it as a music player, and a movie watching device while away from wireless in the car, on a plane, etc, and she wanted to play some games.I did my reading and we seriously considered an iPad for the family with each of our 2 kids putting in $150 or so.I read about the Kindle Fire and Nook Tablet - the Fire only had 8GB of onboard storage at the time, and no micro SD slot.  A deal-breaker.  This was pre Samsung GalaxyTab, Nexus, etc.  Since the Nook Tablet has 16GB and a micro SD slot, we went to a store to take a look.  Sales guy was good, and the device hardware shows well.  Once we got it home and were doing more reading about setup, we found the first of our issues:Issue #1: Onboard Memory========================Of the 16GB of storage, you can only place your own items in 1GB.  The rest is for B&N-purchased; content.  1GB is not enough for a music collection, or any significant amount of video.  A 32GB Class 4 micro-SD card was also in her stocking, having read about this ahead of time.Once she unwrapped it and we set it up (easy enough), annoyance #2 showed itself:Issue #2: App prices and quantity=================================2 Examples: Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja.-  BN Market: $2.99, $3.95.-  Amazon's Android Market: $0.99 (ad-free), with free ad-supported versions available-  Android Market, $0.99 for either, plus free, ad-supported versions available.-  Apple App Store, $0.99 and $0.99, plus free, ad-supported versions available.YouTube: free/pre-installed on all Android/Apple phones/tablets I know of, not available on the Nook Tablet, not in the Nook store.I didn't buy either game, but instead looked back to some of my pre-Christmas reading - U can load Amazon's Appstore without rooting the device, esp. if it's running v1.4.0 of the software.  I got that working and bought $0.99 ad-free Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds.  While I was at it, I side-loaded a few other apps by e-mailing them to myself and web-browsing to get them, and got usb drivers working on an XP laptop so I could sideload via adb over usb.I wasn't home for Christmas, but I did have my work laptop which has music on it.  I copied some over and began to use the music player....Issue #3: Built-in Music Player Limitations===========================================The built-in music player in Android is decent - has been since Android 1.5 - the first version I used.  U can, generally, sort by artist, album, etc, and the UI has dark backgrounds rather than white.  The Nook built-in music player doesn't allow sort. For this, I didn't want to buy a music player, so I went ahead and rooted the device and installed Honeycomb's (Android 3.0's) music player, which is free.  Also put the standard Android YouTube app on since I could now access the Android Market.  The problem wasn't quite solved, because changes to the SD card (adding files) weren't recognized.  I tried Winamp, Songbird and Android 4.0's music player when ICS came out.  They had the same issue.  TTPod does work - you can manually refresh at any time.  I now run Cyanogen, whose music player (modified stock android to add gesture support) works just fine.  They were aware of tablets when they wrote it.This is ironic - B&N; had to do actual work to make it much worse than using the normal android version, plus they had nice opportunities to improve on the experience of a phone due to the large screen - Cyanogen 7 Android supports gestures for music - do an arrow to the left like \"&lt;\", say, and it'll go back a track.  This would be great while driving.(Note that U can unroot by putting a copy of 1.4.0 on an SD card which, though I'm not sure, would probably allow you to return the device if U needed to).Issue #4: Built-in Video Player Limitations===========================================I'd also brought on my work laptop half a dozen videos I nabbed from our TiVos from which I stripped the commercials, saving them as mpg videos.  These wouldn't play with the built-in player.I solved this with MX Player, free version, which plays them fine. U can do this only if U've installed Amazon's App Store or rooted and can access the Android Market. People out there are selling PC software to convert videos to a format Nook Tablet can use. No need - just get another video player.  MX Player Tip: brightness control is an up/down swipe on the left hand side of the screen, volume on the right.Issue #5: UI Inflexibility==========================U can't add shortcuts to the desktop, and can't do much with the sliding apple-style bar either.  For this, I installed App Manager (tough to find a .apk to sideload using adb, so I needed rooting and then got it from Android Market).  This is a fantastic app and I don't use my GoLauncher screen much any more.Also, there's one physical button.  Standard android buttons such as menu (right-click) and back aren't always around in the UI, and holding home doesn't bring up a list of open applications as it does in carrier or stock android.  They should have put those standard 2 buttons on the device.  Update after a month rooted: use Button Savior, which gives soft buttons with a flyout.  Once in a while, you have to use NT Hidden Settings to check USB Debugging unless you use Cyanogen.  Update post Cyanogen: CM7 can have soft buttons (back, menu, home, etc) displayed all the time, if desired, and has Button Savior installed as well.Issue #6: Can only charge with their charger/cable==================================================Nothing more to say.  BlackBerries and Android phones in the house all can charge in the car or at all the computers by just connecting a cable.  It charge very slowly, even if it doesn't tell you it is, when connected to a PC because or other charger.  With some irony, B&N; has had to mail me both a charger and a cable this year due to breakage.  If they could charge with any micro-USB cable, they wouldn't have to.  Update post-Cyanogen: With Cyanogen, it charges with any micro-USB cable, though slowly unless it's the actual Nook stuff - there must be something in hardware.Issue #7: OTA update breaks all the niceness I've achieved==========================================================An OTA update, v1.4.1, will break the ability to mail yourself .apks to be used to enable non-BN apps to install and to enable debugging.  I imagine U could have done these steps while on 1.4.0 and gotten sideloading via PC/adb to work, but U can't disable OTA updates.  U can if you root, though, so I did, then used SQLite to modify a setting to only update when done manually. It'll never auto-update.  Update post-Cyanogen: irrelevant now.Goodness #1: Hardware is pretty sweet=====================================Snappy, installs apps fine, opens them quickly, videos are fairly smooth, scrolling is pretty good (but not as nice as Apple's).Screen is great from angles, clear and bright.It's lightweight and can be held easily in one hand.Speaker is pretty loud - louder than any of our phones except maybe BlackBerry.Goodness #2: the Reading Aspect===============================The reading end of the device is well-implemented, though I give Amazon's original Kindle and all subsequent ones and advantage - an order of a book on an original kindle appeared on the device in less time than it took me to back out of the purchase UI.  Doing so from the web is also very fast.  A web order using a computer of a B&N; sample appeared about an hour later, but quite snappily when done from the device.Goodness #3: Books with Videos/Sound====================================Yes, these are available on Kindle Fire and iPads. I know. I do like the talking kid's books (reminds me of a LeapFrog Tag pen, but without the ability to touch words and hear them), and the free cookbook sample had a video of making a chocolate sauce.  This is good for cooking!  U can see what each stage is supposed to look like.Goodness #4: Good if U Root it, for $250========================================When rooted, it's a nice tablet + it has the B&N; connection, and it cost $250.  It isn't an iPad (no cameras or BT), and it's half the price.  Update Nov 2012: There are now a multitude of 7\" tablets (ASUS, Samsung, Google) which get my recommendation.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Very Limited Unless You Modify It", "unixReviewTime": 1325462400, "reviewTime": "01 2, 2012"}

More zippy than the Kindle Fire. Ereading is also a pleasure, with customizable fonts & backgrounds. I was surprised at how well I was able to read on it outside in the shade. It still has a lot of glare, but it is much more readable than the Ipad or the Kindle Fire.I can't see the Ipad or Kindle Fire screen at all outside with all the glare. Nook HD is NOT as readable as an eink screen, so I will be keeping my original Nook of 3 years for outdoor reading. But for a tablet ereader, I was really surprised at how well it did outside in the shade. I have since given my husband the Ipad 2, as I like the 7\" form factor of the ereader/tablet devices. I take them with me everywhere. If you were to ask me which I liked better, the Kindle Fire or the Nook HD...well...I wouldn't be able to choose. Amazon has a larger store for books, apps, movies etc....but I like B&N's Nook HD for it's interface, superb screen and customizable home screen. It also has expandable memory, and you can sideload epub books. I also like the look of the Nook HD better. It would come down to personal preference and which store you have the most investment with. All in all, the Nook HD is a great device that hasn't gotten the attention it deserves, and is worth serious consideration.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great little device!", "unixReviewTime": 1361145600, "reviewTime": "02 18, 2013"}

Magazines on this screen are amazing, I especially like reading Time because of the outstanding photography they do. Books look great, and the selection of games on the Barnes and Noble store is alright. A little annoying paying again for games I already bought on my phone, but that's not so bad.Further, you really don't need to pay again for games if you install a custom ROM on an SD card. You can either purchase one premade (google for N2A for more info) or you can burn your own if you google a little more and spend the afternoon trying different things. It's not scary at all, especially since you're only doing stuff on the SD card not the tablet itself. If you want to undo it, just take the card out! Anyway, the custom ROM just gets you stock android, and that opens this great device up to the full android market of games and apps. You can still read all your Barnes and Noble stuff on the B&N; android app. I read my Wired subscription that way, as well as some books.

I discovered this Nook tablet has no camera at all. Who ever heard of such a thing? There is a reasonable expectation.The Nook downloaded and upgraded itself famously. Everything was smooth and cheerful.The speed of the Nook was very good in my opinion. Page to page was smooth and cheerful and moderately fast. The book pages are easy to read. Another Dan Brown book (I think). Made the discovery with Inferno. Played/watched Linux Action Show and other video for about 3 hours with about 15% of the battery power left.Checked YouTube and Amazon to see the how the graphic's engine worked in the Nook. The motion pictures were crisp and clear on YouTube and Amazon. The sound was very excellent and voluminous much to my surprise. Can hear the device clearly and with ease even though I am kinda hard of hearing. The movie scenes moved like a big computer rendering of the graphics. The motion pictures were like a TV broadcast. Not kidding.Now the ultimate bummer: their much touted microSDHC card can not play your own content downloaded from a computer. Later, several hours later there was an additional patch of 75 upgrades that made the microSDHC capable of playing video files/movies. The selection it can play is very limited compared to other more recent operating systems in Android devices. The latest Android operating system is 4.4 KitKat. The Nook will not play certain AVI or HD files. It is very persnickety  What the Nook can play is rendered exceptionally well indeed. It can only play things downloaded from Nooks libraries for sale-wrong as mentioned.

The software and usability is noticeably different though, and that's where you should pay close attention.  I bought my wife the Nook Tablet for Christmas and she uses it a fair amount.  I haven't heard any major complaints from her but here are the ones I've heard most often.The Barnes and Noble App Store is a joke.  I looked through it for about 5 minutes and barely ever saw a free app.  Many popular apps and games are there, but usually you can only get the paid version.  Adding insult to injury, side-loading is difficult if not impossible without rooting the device (this will void the warranty).  I didn't expect side-loading to be a given really, but if you block those apps you really need a decent App Store to make up for it.The SD card slot, which many people may not ever use, is in a pretty odd spot.  It's not really hard to pry back the cover but since you're working with a micro-SD card it can be really annoying to  line up such a tiny card in the slot.  If that wasn't annoying, it is definitely annoying to load your PDFs or whatever from the SD card once its inserted.  For someone who isn't really tech-savvy it isn't obvious how to read those files.  The reader app could really do a better job of detecting documents when the SD card is inserted.On the aesthetic side the launcher could use some work.  Although I think the scrolling app dock at the bottom is slightly more elegant than a grid-like app drawer, there's little organization to the home screen.  You can drag icons around, to and from the dock, but apps/books don't lock to any kind of grid on the home screen.  Some of us who are more anal retentive just won't stand for two icons being less than parallel.  You can see a better view of your media by opening the Library app, which is a nice app, but I find the contrast displeasing, further emphasizing this is a tablet with e-reader functions (or vice versa maybe).  Basically the cohesion isn't there and you start to wonder, with all of the restrictions, why you didn't just get a regular tablet.I still haven't rooted my wife's tablet but maybe if something annoys her enough she'll let me do it.  Otherwise, if you're not planning to root the NOOK, beware of its restrictions and browse its App Store for a bit to see if the selection and prices are a deal-breaker.

Fulton", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewText": "(update) I find my review written about Nook HD included here for an entirely different model tablet. Amazon or B*N this is unethical!D.F.---------------Nook HD overviewGreat screen, no cameras, weak speakers, crappy battery life, compromised android OS, but an inexpensive way to browse web and run the world of android apps on a fast, beautiful display. Plus it has a microSD slot to hold lots of videos for offline viewing. And of course, its original purpose, to provide a slick interface for purchase and reading of magazines and books.PlusesWide range of browers available. I have 9 on my machine. All browsers for tablets have reduced functionality so some browsers are better than others for specific tasks. For example, Firefox will play video in HD and does not redirect to mobile sites. Tint and Zirco have a homepage that will access a local html file. With several browsers installed it's easier to get around site restrictions. Firefox has an addon that auto-deletes cookies. Chrome allows spoken search inputs.The world of 700,000 android apps can now be accessed on Nook HD including big and nice apps: Google earth, Skype, YouTube in HD, Adobe Reader, WiFi Analyzer, WiFi Fixer (essential Wifi tool), Google maps, best solitaire ever (by MobilityWare), and free 'run' games. Custom moving backgrounds on Nook HD home screens are fun.AnnoyancesIn two months I have not figured out how to add a browser link to Nook HD home page. Some browsers have the option to add a link to the homepage, but it never works! (It must be that the Nook HD OS does not allow this)Poor battery life, by test I get only 4 hours.Adroid apps normally just suspend, so it tends to take too many presses and taps to cleanly start an application.Audio does not shut off when you exit most radio and music apps. With no OS support for shutting apps down I often have to resort to a reset to silence them.Built-in email has a short time window so you only see few or no messages. Apps like FastHotMail can provide workaround.Screen capture is clumsy (pushing Home and Vol- requires a lot of force and nearly simultaneous pushes).Nook HD not really useful for music, sans headphones, because sound volume on speakers is relatively low.Setting up icons on home screens is kind of a pain. Half of the main screen is taken up by a carousel that cannot be removed. The Nook recommended way of moving an icon to an adjacent screen is to hold icon overlapping the edge, but I find this hit or miss, it only seems reliable after a reset.File directories can be accessed via USB, but have some annoyances: Many file managers have a hard time finding personal files lost in a maze of OS directories. Nook HD allows deletion of its standard user directories (like 'kids B&N; files') only to later write them back again.Tablet does not reliably remember some settings. Occasionally I find the screen will be dim or the notification is too loud and when I look the setting has changed.No way (that I have found) to add personal data for quick entry.(update)Bluetooth keyboard problem solvedI have an inexpensive bluetooth keyboard that works fine with another tablet (Blackberry Playbook), but I could not get it to work with Nook HD. It would pair fine, but nothing happened when keys are hit. I see others complaining of this too. Finally I solved the problem with an app called BlueInput (available on Play Store). It now does the pairing, not Nook OS, and you select the bluetooth keyboard using 'Switch Keyboard' icon.(update)Fix for adding web link icons to the home page. Some browsers have the option to add a bookmark to Home, but this never seemed to work in Nook HD. I think I now understand the source of the problem. The default Nook HD launcher (with carousel) ignores them. The work around is to install the Nova launcher, and it will show them on the home screens.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Cheap way to browse web and run android apps on a fast, beautiful display", "unixReviewTime": 1374796800, "reviewTime": "07 26, 2013"}

On the Nook ST, the Library screen shows icons for all the ebooks loaded in the device (both library and purchased). Touch the icon, and the ebook opens. Turning the page? Touch the screen on the right side of the page (to go forward) or the left side (to go back). Or swipe your finger across the screen as in flipping a physical book page. Or use the buttons built into the frame. Want to page quickly through a book? Hold down the page turning button. Need a word definition? Touch and hold on the word and a dictionary pops up. The user interface resembles that of an iPhone or iPad, with the icons, virtual keyboard and the physical home button. It even has the \"slide to unlock\" feature like the iPhone.  The touchscreen on the Nook ST is infrared (it senses the heat of your finger, again like iPhone), so a light touch works just fine.  I found that on the original Nook, sometimes it would take multiple touches on the LCD screen for the device to recognize a command.I returned the original Nook since the Nook ST is so much better. Note that the Nook ST doesn't have 3G connectivity, a web browser, or an MP3 player. If you want all that, buy the original Nook. If you don't require all of these features and would like a basic e-reader with an intuitive touch screen interface, then take a look at the Nook ST.The Nook ST is just beginning to become available (only at B&N; right now), but I suspect that Amazon and other high quality retailers will be selling it very soon.Here's another plus for the Nook (whether it is the original one or the ST).  The Kindle has a proprietary ebook format that limits your options in purchasing and reading ebooks.  Nook uses Adobe EPUB, which is an open format and there are multiple online sites that offer books in this format (including most public libraries).", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "This Nook is Good, but the new Nook Simple Touch is WAY Better", "unixReviewTime": 1307232000, "reviewTime": "06 5, 2011"}

I would constantly diss the e-readers claiming that books were soooo much better. Then I ordered a book series from Amazon and the books/print was so tiny that I could barely read them without straining my eyes and driving myself crazy. My mom (&lt;3!!) gave me my brothers old nook since he had a new nook color so I could download and read the series on this. It wasn't cheap to download the books, but compared to reading the free versions a friend had sent me (which were horrible because the text was all messed up...typos galore) but the option to make the text larger or smaller and the clarity of the screen made the 8+ dollars per book soooo worth the price.The battery on this lasts so long it's insane. I would read daily maybe 5 hours per day over the summer (hey, I had to finish the series before school resumed!) and I only had to charge it once a week tops, even then the battery wasn't drained I just didn't want to give it a chance to run out. I am so in love with my nook now it's insane. I can download almost any book I could possibly need and carry it around in this tiny little, lightweight nook.Another big plus....MY BOOKMARKS DON'T FALL OUT OF THE NOOK!! Nothing is more frustrating than losing your place and going bananas trying to find it without revealing something you haven't read yet.Also, when it comes to textbooks this is a lifesaver!! My back loves the nook. I cannot recommend the nook (or any e-reader in general) enough. You can still buy physical books (I do and will never stop because I absolutely love them) but for an avid reader the nook is such a great addition to your life.Even though my first nook was free (making it that much sweeter), I would gladly lay down $100+ for a replacement if anything happened to mine or for a newer model, not the color though, that's more like a tablet PC than an e-reader.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "From hater to smitten with this amazing little device...", "unixReviewTime": 1317513600, "reviewTime": "10 2, 2011"}

Owen \"Contrary Insight\"", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewText": "I asked for this e-reader for Christmas due to seeing it in a Barnes and Noble store and learning about its features. It  offers greater compatibility with different ebook formats than the Kindle (particularly the EPUB format), has access to special offers when you're inside a Barnes and Noble store, and permits you to lend books to other Nook users. There's also a little color LCD touch screen at the bottom for accessing menu options.Personally, I haven't taken advantage of most of the Nook's features yet, but I do like what I see so far. The touchscreen adds a great deal of versatility to the device and I'd say it's easier to access menu options this way than with just one e-ink screen and some buttons. I also appreciate the ability to upgrade the memory with a microSD card, but I would have preferred to do so without opening the device. Also, if you have a problem with the Nook, you shouldn't have a problem getting a replacement. I, er, damaged my first Nook through, shall we say, \"user error,\" but B&N; staff was happy to provide a new one for me.It's not quite perfect, though. It's kind of heavy, for one thing. The touchscreen is a bit slow to respond and can significantly drain the battery, for another. And, some of the Nook's buttons seem to be a little too stiff. I prefer soft, clicky buttons, you know? Maybe in its next iteration the Nook will have proper buttons instead of this \"bendy plastic\" business.Anyway, which e-reader you get largely boils down to your personal preferences, and which retailer's online library you'd rather have access to. For my part, I think the Nook satisfies all of my needs just fine. Be careful where you buy it from, though. $180, which is the price it's selling for on Amazon right now, is way too much when you can just walk into a brick and mortar store and get it for thirty bucks less.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An excellent e-reader", "unixReviewTime": 1295481600, "reviewTime": "01 20, 2011"}

I wanted to consider a Kindle but they were not available locally so I was very hesitant to buy one sight-unseen.BN had just released their wifi-only version for $149 which was very reasonable. I bought one from BN with moderate research and minimal hands-on. I have regretted it ever since.Today I said goodbye to my nook library and bought a kindle3. I can't comment on it very much except it is light-years faster than the nook and the interface actually works. I have about 90 books in my nook library, most of which I paid for so I'm a little frustrated.Things that are good about the nook:1. It looks much better than a kindle. While it sits there unused on my nightstand.2. ePub support. I live in Alaska which means it will be another 5 years before our libraries start loaning books via epub so it's not a big deal for me.3. Free Fridays. Every Friday nook owners can download a BN-selected book for free. Most are crappy fantasy/romance books but I have discovered several very good authors that I wouldn't have otherwise.Things that are bad about the nook:1. Awful, awful, awful touch input. I cringe thinking about using my nook with the unwieldy touchscreen. The screen itself is slow to respond, it sometimes registers additional clicks but mostly just ignores them while giving you visual feedback so you wait 5-10 seconds for it to actually do nothing.The touchscreen display is very jerky and difficult to navigate. You navigate the menus by scrolling through them on the touchpad. It will randomly jump to the top or the bottom. It will randomly ignore a touch (there is visual feedback, so it's not a mis-touch). It will randomly click twice on the succeeding menus.Trying to type on the keyboard or use it to look up a word (you need to use arrow keys on the touchpad to scroll a sluggish cursor around the page to pick one) is a test in patience I no longer have patience for. The keys provide visual feedback when pressed. This suggests you can type away merrily until you look at the text field to see only 2 or 3 characters were actually used. You have to type very sloooow and deliberate for the gnomes inside to catch up with you.The touchscreen is the main reason I ditched the nook. It is horribly implemented and makes the entire device borderline unusable.2. Browser. The BN rep sure talked that up. After spending 15 minutes trying to use the browser to register a BN account so I could actually read books I gave up and used my laptop. The browser takes about 30 seconds on average to display a page. It doesn't matter if it's a real page, the mobile version of Facebook or just google search. It will also randomly crash every minute or two. And by crash I mean you will suddenly be returned to the home screen for no apparent reason.Do not buy the nook if you even think you might want to try using it as a browser to check your email while you're sitting in bed reading a book.3. Battery life sucks. Sorry, but it does. I like to read a lot and having to charge it every couple days makes me upset they claim a 14-day battery life on it. I think it gets about 14 hours per charge (minus the 10% when it automatically goes to sleep). There is a persistent charging bug with the nook, or at least with mine; If you have wifi enabled but the device is sleeping (as in just normally leaving wifi on) when you plug it in to charge, the wifi will activate internally as it (I assume) checks with BN for book updates. This stops the charging and it will not resume unless you turn off the wifi and unplug and replug the charging cable.This is very frustrating as you plug the device in and forget to turn off the wifi. The next morning you grab it only to see the cute \"Your battery is too low to operate\" message.4. It weighs about 20% more than the kindle and is noticeably thicker. Not a big deal, but if you're in bed reading with one hand it weighs about as much as a heavier hardcover which means you're switching hands every so often. Heavier does not always mean better.5. Page turns. When I first got the nook it took between 3-5 seconds to turn a page. I would actually press the page turn button when I got to the last paragraph and could finish it before the page turned. A software update has vastly improved the page turn speed (about .5 seconds now) but only when turning the actual book pages. Library pages, shopping and browsing shelves still take 3+ seconds. I have tried a factory reset twice and either my device is defective (BN support did not think so) or it still sucks. This also strongly influences the cursor movement speed when trying to select a word and the speed at which you can enter text.6. Screen readability is acceptable. It looks like the page was printed on a crappy inkjet printer, with pixilation apparent. The kindle is more crisp and darker.7. The included Merrium Webster dictionary is broken. A large number of entries simply do not work. If you search for one of the effected entries the nook performs a search before inexplicably returning you to the book page. I do not remember which letter(s) are affected but it does not appear to be priority for BN to fix.8. Shelves. Shelves are BN's answer to everyone complaining how difficult it is to find books in the library. You can create a custom named shelf and place books on it. It is very clunky and sluggish and expect to spend 30 seconds trying to find your new book and another 15 trying to put it on a shelf. Sometimes it just won't let you put a book on a shelf and you have to restart the nook. This adds another 2 hours because you will be so frustrated by this point you will put the nook down start punching holes in the wall.9. Sometimes books fail to open. This means you have to go back to your library and open the book again. I have no idea why it happens but it happens frequently enough to mention. Once you get a book open and keep reading that book until you're finished it works well enough. But the menus, navigation and overall usefulness is virtually nonexistent.10. It's built on an android platform, which means it's buggy and randomly crashes or stops working. A restart usually solves this, but I keep shouting \"WHY, WHY, WHY\" every time I have to. Although I haven't had to restart it since I got the kindle. This may or may not be a result of not using it any more.Closing thoughts: I would encourage you very strongly to use one before buying it and investing in an e-library only to find yourself in the same situation I found myself. If you really have your heart set on it, buy from a local BN and try it out for a couple weeks so you can return it. I waited for the nook software update that was supposed to fix all these problems. After that seemingly only addressed the page turn speed I was outside of the return period and stuck with this nice-looking nightstand decorum.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Save your money, or 10 reasons the nook is awful", "unixReviewTime": 1305417600, "reviewTime": "05 15, 2011"}

At the current price, I think it's a good deal but I'm not sure it would be my choice if I could roll back time.  I originally purchased this because I wanted to rent ebooks from the Library and that wasn't an option with the Kindle.  Now, they come for the Kindle as well as in epub and pdf formats.  You can basically use any ereader to rent these now.I read all these reviews saying that the black and white was like paper, easiest to read.  It's not anything like a paper book, it's far less \"bright\" when it comes to reading.  Don't get me wrong, I love ebooks.  I haven't read a paper book in a year.  It is just that even in regular light it is not as easy to see for me.  You absolutely can read it without a light during the day, but it is not nearly as crisp or easy as it would be with a paper book.  I have a clip on light, and with that it's perfect at night.  I'm able to read in bed and not disturb my husband, if one wants a black and white reader as close to paper as you can get--I'm just not sure this is what one would expect.This reader has a browser which you can use to get on the internet.  It was handy when we were in a hotel with wifi and I didn't bring the laptop and I needed to know when a business opened.  It's certainly not easy to surf, this would not be my choice to use unless in a pinch.The battery does not last as long as I expected.  I get maybe a week and a half out of it, if I turn it completely off when not using it--and if I have it on airplane mode (not wifi enabled).  I do read at least a few hours a day.  The time is much shorter if I let it just hibernate.I am not sure if the text size options are specific to the device or the book.  It appears to me it is the device that offers limited options, though it varies based on the originating text of the book. The text size on extra large--the largest option-- is often (it varies by book) small enough that it would equal that of a normal book.  My vision is pretty good and occasionally I'm annoyed by how small extra large is.  In some books medium is the same as extra large in others.  I do think that for anyone with vision challenges, limited text size might be an issue.Obtaining books is easy to do through Barnes and Noble.  You need to go online on a computer and provide a credit card.  You can then order them on the computer, or through your device.  I generally use the computer, but if you know what you want--ordering directly from the Nook is quick and easy.  Transferring library rentals is also as easy as drag and drop, using Adobe Digital Solutions (free app, the library should have a link to download it).All in all, it's a good ereader.

Well many moons ago I worked at Barnes and Noble and stopped in to visit and old friend.  He introduced me to the Nook, I shrugged up my nose and said, 'Yeah, I'm sold on the Kindle.'After playing around with the Nook, I really found myself enamored of it.  I like the touch screen.  I like that the battery replacement if necessary is something the consumer can do.  I liked that you could share your nook books with others.  On the Nook that I have -and I did purchase a refurbished Nook - games included are suduko and chess.  The daily is a feature that automatically downloads articles specifically for the Nook users.  The library is where you can store all of your books and create shelves for your titles and organize the titles.  Shopping is a breeze, either directly on the nook or online.  You will need a card, be it debit or credit to purchase the books, you can use gift cards, but I believe that you need to have a card on file.I can store and listen to music on my Nook, I can access the internet (mine is WiFi) and use it to search and answer email or update facebook.In short, I'm madly in love with it.  I have not had any problems with it.  The charge holds for a pretty long time, I haven't measured it in time myslef.It is simple to use, very friendly and there is an incredible book selection for the Nook.  i happen to be a big fan of classic literature and Russian literature and I have had no trouble filling up my library.  Storage capacity is quite large and i have an additional micro SD card just in case, but I am no where near filling up my storage yet.The books are also available on my personal computer, and if I decide to archive a book, but do not necessarily want to delete the title altogether, I can archive it and later retrieve that title from my online account.  Archiving titles would allow you to free up space on your Nook.Recommendations, I have a silicone slip cover to protect my Nook if I drop it, I also have a slightly hardcover case to protect the Nook when it is in my purse, I do have a book light as the screens are not backlit to avoid glare.The only downside, some fools will think your screen is paper and they will touch it in awe and smudge up your reading screen.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I really love this", "unixReviewTime": 1293667200, "reviewTime": "12 30, 2010"}

I begin to research e readers.. I even went to the store and tested the nook, played with it. I went to other stores that had other e readers and looked at them as well. Then one of my coworkers showed me her Kindle and I was able to play with it and look at it.Then the i pad came out, So I went to the store and looked at the i pad and played with it as well. I have read review after review and watched you-tube...Well The holidays came and my husband bought me the Nook!!! I was so excited! I wanted the Nook as soon as I saw it, but took my time and compared it to other e readers.. I knew right from the start which e reader I wanted after being in discussion with others about e readers and after looking and playing with a few of them.Right out of the box the Nook, made me happy and gave me confirmation of my long desire to own the Nook. My husband knew that I wanted it, but I waited trying to justify why I needed an e reader and to see if anyone of them would go beyond my expectations. The Nook did exactly that! For me the Nook was worth the money and time it took to decide on which one to purchase... Here is why I love the Nook, I can lend books to other, I can download from my library which is so awesome! I can surf the net for FREE!!!!!! no monthly fees like the i pad, It fits in my computer bag, purse, which makes it so easy to take with me, It has my favorite games, Chess and Sukodu! It was easy for me to download a ebook that I already have, but have been unable to read due to me not wanting to tote my lap top around, the book loaded right from my lap top to the Nook in no time... The amount of free books that are available to the Nook, and the daily free treats from Barnes And Nobles! Which will more than pay for the Nook over time. Being able to call Barnes and Nobles and talk to a live person over the phone and being able to walk in the store and get face to face customer service.I also like the fact that when you are in the store you can read ebooks for free for an hour and download more free ebooks! For me It was the right choice for our family, as when we go to Barnes and Nobles with our children we can stay longer now that we have the nook and can receive free treats and more free ebooks! It pays for itself... These are some of the reason why I love my nook and I am excited that I received the Nook for a gift! I can not say enough about the Nook, I don't have to be tied to one book store like Itunes, Ibook, are the Kindle store... I don't like limits and the Nook allows me to be free to choose where to get my books from...Now with that said, When I visited my local Barnes and Nobles and received a free smoothie, It was so stress free and everyone was so nice.. I could not believe it!I have also downloaded music that I can listen to and have my ear plugs for that, I have also downloaded several books which was so easy to download that I was shocked! I like getting my monies worth, and not having to pay extra monthly fees.Now with that said, I hope that when you do your research you will consider the Nook, I am surprised that there are not more reviews than the current number of reviews. Well back to my Nook, as I can not put it down!What a great gift, and a great buy!!!**************Update****************5/30/2011The Nook is still awesome... Since I have owned the Nook for a while now, I came back to offer an update..As far as downloading books, I downloaded books the other day and before I could blink they were on my Nook!I am still happy with my Nook and love my Nook! I have recommended the Nook to friends and family who have also made purchases and are happy with the Nook as well.The performance of my Nook is awesome, and I have had great experiences with my Nook since the day I was surprised with the Nook as a gift! Best gift anyone can give! The joy of reading!I take my Nook with me every where! My children are still in love with my Nook and love to play the games on my Nook or read a book. My husband even likes for the children to read books on the Nook. The Nook has brought so much fun and the joy of reading to our family!You can also go to Barnes and Nobles and take classes to learn more about your Nook as there is so much to learn and so much that the Nook has to offer. Check in your area to see what times your local Barnes and Nobles offers classes.I also like the Nook because the Nook continues to educate you on a daily basis with the daily blog of what took place on the days of the week, for example if you turn on your Nook right now and go to the daily, it will inform you what took place on this date. Which to me is a neat feature as you get to learn something new about something you may have  not known.As far as the touch screen part of the Nook, we love it! It does not distract us but adds to the beauty of the Nook in our opinion. It is easy for my family to use.********2012 Update*****Well it is 4/24/2012 and I still love my Nook and my Nook still works great! I just wanted to give another update for individuals looking for a e reader.As of this date, our children are now asking as they did before can they have my Nook. And for now they can use my Nook, but I still love Nook and I am not ready to give my Nook up. One day we will purchase Nooks for the whole family.As far as use, I was out in the sun and reading with no problem. So many e reads and tablets are currently on the market. This nook still works for me and still performs and amazes me. There is still so much to learn with the Nook I currently own. If you are looking for a great affordable e reader.

I've also spent dozens of hours on the telephone with Nook support and other activities related to keeping it running.  I'm an experienced software designed/programmer, engineer, etc. and I can assure you that compared to a paper book, this is a seriously flawed concept.  If you insist on buying an eBook reader, make sure you allocate plenty of time that you could have better spent on reading a real book to spend on arguing on the telephone with foreign call center reps.  B&N;'s concept of customer support is severely lacking and they appear to have little knowledge when it comes to supporting electronic gear.On top of those problems, consider the very concept of the electronic book.  While you will pay close to the same price you'd pay for a real book on sale, you won't own the book - you'll have a license to use it.  When you're finished with the book, maybe you'd like to be able to loan it to a relative or friend, but you can only do that if they have a Nook and you can loan it for two weeks only.  I suppose when the two weeks is up, the borrower sees the book disappear, finished or not.And then there's the odd problem of your Nook for some reason being tied closely to the email address you had on file with B&N; when you registered your Nook.  I recently had to change my email address and updated my B&N; account with the new address and new B&N; password.  After that, I could no longer download books, and was unable to unregister and register my Nook (that was supposed to fix the problem, according to the support center).  If you happen to get yourself into that dilemma, be ready for a long drawn-out session on the telephone.  The problem was that B&N; neglected to spell this situation out on their website when I changed my email address.So, if you're into \"going green\", driving a hybrid car (and thinking it's going to save you money in the long run), then the Nook may be for you.  If all you want to do is read, forget the Nook and go to the local library or bookstore and spend your time reading.  Give the price of the Nook to a local charity.

Before I purchased it, I spent weeks researching the differences between the Barnes and Noble Nook and the Kindle and other ereaders. I chose the Nook because I can read .epub format books on it; something you cannot do on the Kindle. The Kindle only supports .pdf files and ebooks in the proprietary Amazon.com format. That severely limits the number and type of ebooks you can read.With the Nook, I have borrowed free ebooks from my local library and within minutes downloaded them to my computer and then transferred them to my Nook. AWESOME! In addition, unlike the Kindle, I can read free ebooks available from Google.The only thing I don't like about the Nook and the Kindle is that neither one of them has a back-lit screen so, at night or in the dark, you have to have alternative ample light. So I either turn on a lamp or use the small, clip-on light I bought at the local RiteAid for about $10. It works just fine.So far, I have had no problems navigating my ebooks; everything works smoothly and the pages turn quickly. I'm enjoying the convenience of being able to travel with 30 books and audio-books at a time. I also have some music loaded on my Nook so I can listed to it while I read. Lastly, I'm glad I bought a case for it because I pretty much take it every place I go so the hard case prevents the screen from getting scratched or broken.I'm very happy with my purchase.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Terrific eReader", "unixReviewTime": 1284249600, "reviewTime": "09 12, 2010"}

(I have a teeny tiny little hoarder of books inside of me!) But then I finally caved and decided to try one because of my difficulty in reading larger and heavier books laying in bed at night, and due to being away from home for periods of time where I couldn't easily carry a dozen books with me.The first reader I had experience with was when my grandpa had purchased one of those huge honkin' Kindle DS readers with the full key pad. I was excited about that one, but the price was WAY out of range. I decided to try and go with the Nook (after my typical pre-purchase ritual of spending days doing research on the best option) and I was so thrilled with it, I had nothing bad to say. I used that little beauty for a few good years, until I was forced to sell it to help pay bills. From the very moment the Nook left my hands I regretted it. I was certain I'd never find one that good again. And I don't believe there has been any readers since then that are that good still!Fast-forward to this Black Friday. The FIRST Black Friday when I actually HAVE some money to spend! And I am looking for a really good e-reader! I did come across the Nook on Amazon, and saw the new Nook Simple Touch, which intrigued me, because I wanted to stick with the e-ink display, and not have a full-size touch screen battery killer. Finally, I realized my love for the original Nook had never died, and it still had everything I could ever want in an e-book reader. I was even able to buy one from a vendor here on Amazon, who lived less than half an hour away from me, and it only cost me $50!!!

I already own a Kindle latest generations, 3g/wifi.  However I soon discovered that not all books are available on the Kindle and 99.9% of the books I couldn't get on my Kindle are on Nook.  After much research I soon learned that if you want good ebook reader you buy either a Kindle or a Nook.  So I asked Santa for it.I will not tell you I like the Nook better than my Kindle or my Kindle better than my Nook.  Both have excellent features that make them both excellent ereaders.Here's a few on the Nook:  1- It keeps the book title, time, and battery charge visible while reading.  2-It starts up just a bit faster than the Kindle.  3-You can use your own photos for the screen saver and wallpaper.  4-it recognizes the table of contents in PDF books.  5-it reads EPUB file types (meaning you can buy books from Borders.com too and read them)As for the Kindle here are a few features I love about it:  1-I like the real keyboard as the buttons are much easier to push than on screen.  2-It reads PDFS much better than the Nook, more so when you have the PDF converted.  3-the page turns are a bit faster.  4-I prefer the black housing to white.  5-the reading page/screen has no glare at all (the Nook's little color panel on the bottom is very reflective) and it seems the print is a little darker.Both the Nook and Kindle are very easy to purchase and load books on.  I think the thing I was most disappointed in with the Nook are the covers.  They are not enough covers that actually close, like the Kindle and when sticking this reader into your purse or bag, you don't want the cover to open and scratch the screen/reading surface.If you are looking for a great ereader, you cannot go wrong with this Nook or the Kindle latest generation, in my book they are both on the top shelf.  Now if we could just get one that is a smashed together version of both their great features into one unit.Update:  After using both my Nook and Kindle for a while now I've decided I do like the Kindle much better than the Nook.  The page turning buttons on the Kindle are very very light touch, the reading screen does have darker print, and the collections feature is top notch.  Now my Nook, the buttons take some pushing to turn the pages, the reading screen is lighter, and the shelves option is ok.  What I don't care for in the shelves feature is I can't colapse the shelves to just show the shelves and then open them when I want to search in them.  I also don't care for the B&N; Library being seperate from My Documents.  On the Kindle these are all included together and you can sort them out using collections.  With the Nook you must use the naviation screen to switch between them.  I've also had some trouble with the navigation screen on the bottom.  I don't have large fingers and don't wear long fingernails so moving around on the screen should be easy.  However, when I'm tryting to scroll or select something on the touch screen I just can't seem to get what I want.  But when I don't mean to move on the touch screen but accidently touch it, I trigger a menu move.  It's still a very good reader, but when comparing options and usability, I'd choose the Kindle any day over the Nook.

My first attempt at owning a Kindle resulted in two failing devices for which I eventually obtained a refund.My birthday is today; my brother asked me what I wanted two weeks ago and I told him the Kindle. Unfortunately at that precise moment Amazon was right in the middle of rolling out the new Wi-Fi only Kindle and all models were unavailable.  So, I went for the barnes & noble nook Wi-Fi only.Considering my previous experience with the Kindle, I tried not to get too excited. I went on the net to read reviews of the nook and was fearful. I read that it was buggy, that it lagged when you changed pages, that the touch interface was not all that responsive.All of this was wrong; the page turns are quick and do not interrupt the flow of reading.  The touch interface is very nice and I like seeing my book covers in color. When you choose the Cover Flow, your books slide by with the touch of a finger and you simply tap on the book you want to read at that moment.  This was surprisingly helpful when I went to make purchases on the B&N; Store. I know you don't judge a book by its cover, but how many times has a nice colorful packaging led me to a book I wanted to read, uhm; many times. I was really intrigued with the \"swipe\" page turn that you used the touch screen for, however this did not seem to function correctly on the store model or on my own nook. Strangely, after a period of time, it now works perfectly. A representative told me it simply had to adapt to my touch...I don't know how much I trust that statement, however when she turned a page on the display nook it responded to her very well. (Perhaps it was a learning curve?)Side-loading documents: Wow, if you have any epub or pdf documents all you have to do is side load them and voila.  I do recommend a free program called Calibre, which organizes your books, helps you edit the tags, add a color cover, or convert to epub. Pdf is not very easy to read on the nook, but if you convert to epub it goes smoothly, unless there are alot of photos or images, which lessens the accuracy of the conversion. Calibre has even converted files like, Word-Doc, Html, Palm, etc. Calibre will let you pick and choose books to upload to the nook directly from the program; in other words it 'sees' the nook.Drawbacks to the nook: The battery life, that nifty little color touch screen eats the battery power like mad.  B&N; claim that you get 10 days, cut that in half. I do not know if this is because I use the touch screen to do my page turns or not,(the other option being the side buttons) but I am leaning toward, maybe? LCD screens notoriously use power; but using the page turn function does not require the back-light to be on, so I am not sure how it is eating up the battery so badly. It is honestly not that much of a problem for me. I am around my computer so much that it is unlikely a day will go by without it being attached to the CPU or an outlet next to my bed. I have gone almost four days with not re-charging; and I could see that little power icon decrease at least to slightly more than half in that time.Oh - and that nifty little cover flow on the color screen.  Don't expect it to work for Your Documents.  (There are two libraries, the B&N; purchased books and your side-loaded books or documents.) Also there is no way to sort your documents to your specification so you either sort by author, title, or the date you loaded them, very annoying if you build up a nice library; which is highly likely considering you can add an SD card to your nook and increase memory to 16 maybe 32 gigabytes. Speaking of which with that ability to increase memory, it would have been nice if the MP3 Player interface were a little more sophisticated.  An interesting ability is to play an unabridged audio-book and read the book at the same time. I am not sure who would do that, but then again I understand spoken Spanish more than I am capable of reading it.  This might be useful to me in that area, if I can find the matching audio-book/ Spanish-book. (Nuance in foreign language is often lost in English translation.)Never having owned a functioning 3G eBook-reader, I never really missed it with my home Wi-Fi. I have discovered several places close to where I \"haunt\" which have AT&T; free to my nook. I already have a huge collection of books lined up for me to read... so feeling a \"need\" for the 3G seems unlikely. I have always done this, collected books that line up, ready for me to read. (By the way... the in store B&N; Wi-Fi connection has s*cked at every B&N; store I have been to. Amazingly Border's free Wi-fi worked better, I just couldn't buy through the B&N; store. I had to go to my smart phone, buy the book, and it uploaded.)So how do I feel about my nook; I absolutely love it! To be fair however, had I received a functioning Kindle, I would have felt the same way about it, I am certain. I think the Kindle has deficiencies with the lack of a touch/color interface and the side loading documents ability. However, that screen kills the battery as I stated.  The reason for liking the separate touch interface is that you don't want to touch your e-ink screen; I don't see how Sony's all touch interface e-reader is going to be popular when you are smudging your read screen all the time, though I must admit I would like to try one out.The nook is comfortable in all sorts of positions, laying in bed, on the couch, holding it next to you; even laying it away from you and increasing the font so that you could read without holding it. I highly recommend a reading light, especially if you had grown accustomed to reading LCD screens in the dark (my kindle program on my Android phone.)It is rather frustrating, I would have preferred a Kindle simply because I was impressed with Amazon customer service when my Kindle malfunctioned.I do recommend the nook. It would be nice if they would lessen DRM restrictions so I could buy books from Amazon or any other place for that matter.SincerlyR", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "nook wifi is it a worthy e-reader?

,{"reviewerID": "A20Y7REXQZ1REW", "asin": "1400532620", "reviewerName": "Ryan Kurtz", "helpful": [11, 11], "reviewText": "First off, I want to start out by saying that I love my Nook. My friend is an employee of B&N; so he was there to help guide me along in my selection and answer any questions I had. So, yes, I did have a little bias to the product to begin with. However, for what I need, this is perfect in almost every single way. In my review I'll compare the Nook to the Kindle ($139 version) and it's major differences, just so people know what I'm talking about in terms of other products as we go down the list.The Bad (If you want to call it that):1. The Nook is a little heavier than the Kindle. I'm not sure of the exact weight differences, but just by feel alone it is a tad bit heavier. Now, that can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. I for one don't find it to be a deal buster, the weight is not catastrophically heavier and uncomfortable, but it is heavier than the Kindle. I do think, however, that the durability of the Nook is a little better compared to the Kindle. The Nook has built in paddles to turn the pages, while the Kindle has flappy paddles along the side that feel as though they could break if I dropped it on it's side or if I touched it to hard. My suggestion for anyone interested in buying the Nook is to also buy a carrying case for it so it makes it easier to read, almost as if you were reading a real book. The covers at B&N; usually start around $30.2. The Nook does have a touch screen that has a bit of glare to it. Some others have posted their reviews of how they dislike the glare when the touch screen goes dark. For me it is a bit distracting if you find yourself wandering away from the text. However, whenever I read a book I find many distractions around me while I read. It's not a huge deal in anyway and some have posted if you turn it to the right angle you won't see your reflection. Again, not a deal buster in anyway I wouldn't think.3. The start up time is atrocious. I can't defend this one in anyway. Amish people can put up houses in a faster amount of time before the Nook would have a chance to get to your homepage. Ok, so not quite that slow, but you get the idea. I haven't timed it yet but I'm going to take an educated guess that it takes around 1-1/2 minutes to start up. That is something that should have been addressed from B&N; to begin with. Again, I can't defend this one in anyway.Ok, so what you have all been waiting for: The Good1. The extra storage feature is superb. The Nook comes with a built in 2GB storage space. Enough for most people, 2GB will get most every book you want to read in your Nook with no problem. However, if you are a fanatic reader that has Newspapers and Magazines delivered to your Nook everyday or every week, this can begin to take up space if you don't free it up. But don't fret! The Nook comes with an extra storage slot for your SD card that can hold up to whatever the highest SD card space is out there. The great thing about it is, SD cards are a lot cheaper today than you would have found 3 years ago, so adding space is cheap.2. The Nook has a featured called \"LendMe\". This is something that the Kindle does not have and I'm sure for competition sake will have in the future. This a great, great, great feature to the Nook! If you have any friends, family or co-workers that have a Nook and have a book on theirs that you would like to read, you can hook up wireless or through the computer and Lend them a copy of it for up to 14 days. If you're a fast reader then you can knock out a 500-600 page book in easily 14 days.3. Your county library might be on the list of Nook rentals. In the county in which I reside in North Carolina, our county library is fortunate enough to have a system in which I can rent books for 14 days from the library. This also is something the Kindle does not have. Before I go off on how great the feature for renting books is, I should point out that the library is going to have a limited selection of books for you to rent. I'm a big Thomas Sowell reader and he has approximately 30 books out on the market. However, the county library that I rent from has only 1 book from his selection. So do you're research before you buy a book, your county library might have it already. The feature, as I have seen, is relatively easy to use. You do have to hard wire your Nook to your computer after you download some software, but it's really simple and the kind people at your local county library can assist you on how to do this. In fact our county library had everything we needed in terms of software and directions on their website.4. Finally. You can take your Nook to B&N; and read any book for up to an hour. Recently I went to grab some coffee at B&N; and wanted to read a book on Ireland. Popped open my Nook, connected to the B&N; network (already programmed into your nook for ease), selected the book I wanted to read from the list I searched on, and wam-bam I was reading a book. You can read lots of books on one Nook from their online selection without having to lug 20 actual books that you wanted to compare before you bought.In closing on this review I would say first and foremost do your homework.

Morales", "helpful": [7, 7], "reviewText": "With these new ereaders on the market, the act of reading has come back to be a very \"in-style,\" technologically advanced and hip thing to do in 2010. Books are now less intimidating and more fun and convenient, and this becomes only more encouraged through Barnes and Noble's Nook.Now, to cut to the chase, the Nook can do most things that the Amazon Kindle can do as well, and while the Kindle holds some ground over the Nook, on an overall scale, if you're looking for a better and more convenient ereader, I'd say to go for the Nook.Both the Kindle and Nook have clear displays, but overall, I would say that the Kindle's display seems to have better resolution. The Kindle also beats the Nook on battery life (as you'll notice that the Nooks battery life seems to last about a week, whereas the Kindle about a month, this is due to the draining power of the Nook's light-up touch screen menu). People may also prefer the button keyboard operation of the Kindle over the Nooks sometimes annoyingly sensitive or not-sensitive-enough touch screen. The Kindle is also thinner and lighter than the Nook. Both have mp3 features though, which helps them. It's always great to be able to read to your favorite music.Now, while it may seem in this paragraph the Kindle has the Nook easily beaten, one must look deeper into finding out why the Nook is a better choice. The reason the nook beats the Kindle is easy - in its navigation, presentation and overall ease of use.The biggest problem with the Kindle (that I noticed) is that the Kindle seems to want to have the look and feel of navigating like a laptop computer in the way it presents the main menu and font size, style and book selection. The problem with this is one thing - this is NOT a computer, it's a portable book, and Barnes and Noble knows this, and made their unit feel way less like just another annoying technological gadget but instead with a \"browsing bookstore\" type of presentation. This is a very BIG difference between the two, and you can sense it even after just a few minutes of toying with it. And this is only talking about the OLDER Nook, I can only imagine how much more amazing of a presentation the color Nook can get with all of its full color pictures and extras.On top of this, the Kindle seems to have placed the turn-page buttons way too attached to the ends, so you actually end up hitting the buttons by accident way too often, whereas the Nooks buttons are more of a soft \"bendable plastic\" type, so you never hit them by accident. This, on top of the little things like being able to slide your finger on the touch screen to turn pages as well as getting book covers and previews, daily logs, etc, give the nook an overall more \"coffee house\" feel which the Kindle doesn't even come close to. And even though the Nook is bulkier and heavier, it actually is made of a more durable softer rubber-like material, and along with the white paneling it makes it feel overall way more professional and studious. Not to mention just more attractive and stylish. This is easily the hipper of the two ereaders. Therefore, things like slightly longer load times, heavier feel, sometimes annoying touch screen and slightly higher price are actually very tolerable once you pick up both units and see and feel the overall difference.Books are an old-fashioned type of entertainment, and while the Kindle tries to make reading and literature just another tacked on 21st century technological piece of unrelatable modernized hardware, the Nook walks the perfect line of bringing the \"old-fashioned\" hobby of reading to a hipper style for the 21st century without taking away the studious professionalism of reading or disrespect the art of literature either. The transition is so much smoother on the Nook that you'll forget you're even reading off of an electronic device.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nook BEATS the Kindle Overall, Reading Revived!", "unixReviewTime": 1292544000, "reviewTime": "12 17, 2010"}

Being electronically challenged, she immediately plopped it in my lap with instructions to \"Buy me a book\". As the nearest B&N; store is 30 miles away I elected to follow the B&N; site to my PC, to the Nook route.  Opening an account on the B&N; site, purchasing a book and downloading it to my PC was easy and fast. Prices are about half that of a printed version. Passing it along to the Nook was another matter.  The Nook came with virtually no usable instructions, either printed or electronic, to explain the procedure that I wanted to use.  After going back to the B&N; site I discovered a little free program called \"Nook for PC\". After downloading that program I was able to copy the book from my PC to the Nook. Everything works fine now, and my wife is addicted to the thing, she takes it everywhere. She still will not, however, try to load new purchases on the Nook.We now have three copies of every book we have purchased, one on the B&N; site, one on my computer, and one on the Nook. With one Nook, it is pretty hard to share after she finishes, and although I can read the books on my PC, that just is not comfortable or practical.  I personally think $150 or so for my own Nook might be a little too much so I am going to look into a cheaper alternative. Walmart has one or two for under $120, one for under $90 that some people like.The Nook is a good option if all you want is a book reader.  The other functions do not seem to work well enough to be practical. The Nook might be a little expensive for what you get, but the service at the B&N; store we visited twice was excellent.  One evening after dinner we visited a B&N; store with Nook in tow. After my wife found a book she wanted, we took the book and the Nook to the Nook counter.  The attendant was happy to purchase the book with her Nook and download it for her.  The book cost for $24 and change, downloaded to the Nook, $12 and change.

The NOOK Color has many features that appealed to me like touchscreen, vivid view technology, brightness adjustments, really nice web browser and mp3 player, etc. So I decided to order one with BlueProton cause they ship it to Canada, and I paid 60 dollars more than the actual price at B&N; and expedited shipping taxes on top of that. I didn't care, I just wanted my NC cause honestly I'm just tired of buying AAA batteries for my Clip light to read my Kindle 3 in bed. I noticed I never read in bright sunlight, I'm an indoors type of reader and I also like to browse while I read, mostly wikipedia and google and the Kindle we browser is primitive.Anyways, I got the NC promptly, I was super excited, but then I tried to transfer my epub books to it and noticed that my computer didn't recognize the unit's drive. Nothing popped. I had my iphone and my kindle plugged in and they were right there. I went to a friend's house and nothing popped on his computer either. A third try at a different laptop and same thing: nada. I went back home and kept trying and all of a sudden I started seeing smoke coming out of the USB port and a smell of burned toast. Really strong. I knew that unit was gone and that freaked me out. Everything else worked perfectly, but the USB was pooched. I returned it and they were very professional about it, but said that they found nothing wrong with the device. I bet they just reset it and tested ome of the features without actually testing its hardware. Anyways, I said I didn't want that unit back. Now here I am, with no Nook Color, nobody else sends it to Canada. I'm contacting friends in the US so I can send it to them, buying it straight from B&N; and then they can mail it to me. It's just weird that at this day and age we still can't have items shipped internationally, even when we're willing to pay more money for that luxury.Now I'm again using my Kindle like crazy, since it's all I got and it never fails. But I'm still gonna buy the NC no matter what. I just don't know if I'll sell my Kindle 3 in the future or keep it because it has sentimental value now, hehe.I think that for 249 US dollars, the NC is the best e-reader in the market. Right now the Kindle still leads and the iPad is coming strong, but 2011 will be the year the Nook Color will establish itself as a great competitor for these other two. If Amazon doesn't come up with a color Kindle with touchscreen, I strongly believe they will be the Betamax and VHS of the 2000s. But I really like the Kindle and if they came up with something like a reader's tablet, I would use it instead of using B&N;'s.

The Kindle is a great device, but I really wanted a color screen.  The iPad would have been a nice option, but was a bit expensive for my taste and a bit too large.  The myriad Android tablets on the market don't seem to get great reviews, though I suspect that will start to change once Android 3.0 is available.The Nook Color was a nice alternative.  Priced a little higher than some of the no-name Asian tablets, but far less than the iPad.  It supports multi-touch, has a decent color display, and the ability to insert micro SD cards into a slot near the \"loop\" on the bottom.Because it supports both ePub and PDF out of the box, you can find a nice selection of books to download (legally) on the web and read on the device without additional investment.  The Barnes and Noble site also offers a limited, but growing, selection of electronic books (both free and for-a-price).  If you get tired of reading, you can use the built-in WiFi and browser to surf the web.  You can also play a couple of the built-in games, with the promise of more coming in a future update from Barnes and Noble.My only complaints so far about the device are that the far edges of the touchscreen seem a little unresponsive, the micro-USB connector is a non-standard type that seems to require use of the proprietary cable.  The connector on the device itself seems to make poor contact with that cable, which makes it difficult or impossible to read on the device while it's charging.Apart from that, battery life has been really good.  I rarely have to plug it in before I am finished reading for the day.The built-in web browser works well, displaying pretty much any web site that an iPad or Android phone can handle.The WiFi seems to find and hold on to signals well, and I don't recall it dropping a connection so far.If you take the time to learn how to \"root\" the device, you can add the Android Market to it and many apps (like the Kindle app) work very nicely on it.

I find the Nook's display easy to read for hours at a time and don't feel that my eyes are any more strained than when I read a printed paper book.  But your mileage may vary.  If e-Ink works better for you, the Kindle is a great alternative.I like the ability to highlight parts of the books I'm reading, take notes inside the book as I read (e.g., to highlight particularly good dialogue, characterization, description, etc., as a writer), and to post updates to Twitter and Facebook about your progress through a book.All in all, this was my favorite 2010 Christmas gift and has (for me) eliminated any desire to own an iPad or any other eBook reader.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very nice eReader with tablet functionality", "unixReviewTime": 1298073600, "reviewTime": "02 19, 2011"}

The impression I got from B&N;'s webpage was that it was for all ebooks.  This was the main reason why I picked these up instead of waiting for the Kindle Fire to be released.  Major disappointment.-Charger cable sucks.  The cable itself is weak where the usb adapter attaches to the cable, and is very easy to bend and break.  one cable is now broken at that spot, and the other is close to it.  These cables are easily replaceable, so not a huge deal, but I expected better quality...  Also, the power adapter is quite bulky.-did not update automatically.  I had to manually install the most recent update (allowing me to disable internet, and install netflix). it was relatively easy to do, following directions from B&N;'s webpage, but there should be a way to check for updates from the device itself.-loses battery life fairly quickly while on standby.-no free games & limited games (maybe apple spoiled me...)-prices for apps and books seem generally higher than on my kindle (I have not made direct comparisons, this is just my general impression)I will try and see if I can lend books through my local library; this may allow me to use it more for it's intended purpose.Overall, the device itself is quite good- just not for what I had intended it for (in store reading- with the option to purchase the book, in print, from the store).If I had purchased the device for myself, however, it would have been returned.  My kids do enjoy reading on it, playing angry birds, watching netflix, etc. so I will keep it for their use.Edit:The nook colours use a usb longer than a standard micro usb; a standard micro usb cable will not charge the nook colour.  I did contact B&N; (I initially took my nooks into a B&N; store for assistance, and was referred to their tech support 1-800 number.  So much for the in store tech support...)  I was able to recieve two new cables under warranty, though.I am generally happy with the tech support provided over the phone, but am still disappointed by the quality of the charging cable, and the inability of B&N; to solve this issue in-store.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "certified refurbished nook color", "unixReviewTime": 1327017600, "reviewTime": "01 20, 2012"}

It can be rooted in about 2 minutes to have app store.  Once that is done, You can use a home screen alternative and program to switch it to hide the overbearing and hindering B&N; store.  It's still there but, not right in my face. Default browser is OK  but, I prefer Dolphin HD.  It's much more than half and Ipad at exactly half the price.  Plus, when used as a reader, it's just light and small enough to be effective at that purpose.  I had a Pandigital novel that I got for Xmas that completely died in 3 weeks.  I took the refund money and made the smartest purchase that I can remember making:  The Nook Color.  The novel is pure garbage compared to this device.  Android 2.1 is so much better than 1.6.  I also couldn't get many apps to run on the novel  where this runs almost everything. Spend the extra $ and get the color.  Save the extra money from the Ipad. I was considering Archos 70 but, I couldn't find anywhere to actually play with it.  Plus, given their history; I had decided against it.Good:Nice screen,  capacitive touch,  strong wifi, decent battery life, Nice CPU @ 800 MHz,  512 MB RAM  Ipad only has 256  supposedly), Tons of free apps available, very reasonably priced,  portable,  Barnes and Noble magazines  very reasonably priced at $1 to $3 an issue), microsd slot.Bad  minor complaints):that silly plastic thing in the corner, mono speaker, micorsd slot instead of sdhc card slot, doesn't come with android market.Overall this is the best tablet for the money currently and probably will be for quite a while.UPDATE.  Couple of small annoyances: randomly reboots instead of sleeping, wireless doesn't come back up sometimes after rebooting.  Still very happy with it though. Sleep issue apparently also happens to those who haven't rooted.  I'm sure it will be fixed with update.UPDATE:  I am very unhappy with Barnes and Noble's many attempts to update my firmware without my permission.  They have tried twice and didn't succeed.  I believe that AVG antivirus is stopping it.  They got my girlfriend's and we have the same nook, that came with same firmware, that was flashed with same mod.  The only thing I can think of was AVG must have stopped it.  They got hers weeks ago and mine is still fine.  She wasn't running AVG and mine was.  It's the only thing I can think of.Who else does that?  I have items from Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, HTC (Sprint), etc and NONE of them update my property.  Who do these people think they are? Well, they won't be updating my firmware and now I won't be buying books from them either.

My favorite is the kindle fire...1.) poor customer service from barnes and noble - the cable breaks easily, and this device is not compatible for swaps... what I mean is like on the kindles you can basically switch out the cables for any micro usb cable... nook color you can not do that... once your nook color is out of warranty, they will no longer replace the cable, so if it breaks, your like SOL until you buy another one for $19.95 + shipping + tax... The cable is really cheap and breaks to easily... I think each time I've had a new cable replaced I could only get it to last about 2-3 uses before it broke... it keeps breaking at the N...2.) the updates are horrible... basically you will have lag issues and the battery will drain easy if you don't update... actually after a while the battery will just start draining anyways and you can't keep charge...3.) it takes forever to turn on... you have to wait like 5 minutes and keep holding the power button and then like another 5 minutes to boot up... with kindle it turns on almost instantly.... After a while, you still have to wait about a minute for the kindle to boot up, but it still loads quicker than the nook color.4.) a feature i like is that the volume buttons are on the side... with kindle fire, you have to dig around to find them... they are in the settings... like you can only adjust the volume on kindle fire through the settings...5.) another feature i like is the card expansion slot. i like to store avi movies from my camcorder and what not on them, and you can't do that with the kindle fire.6.) check each stores content before you buy. each ereader loads different files... this is the main reason i bought both. Most of my textbooks for school are only available through barnes and noble, but I prefer to read on the kindle. After I'm done with school, I'm going to be selling my nook color, but I refuse to get rid of my kindle fire, unless they update to one that has the volume buttons on the side, and plossibly a card expansion slot.

The Kindle was always too expensive and, even now, I don't like the way the screen flashes when \"turning\" pages. After playing around with many different readers, over a period of several weeks, I finally decided to pick up a Nook a couple of months ago.One of my big considerations is that I wanted to be able to read .pdf files in color. The Nook easily satisfied that requirement. What I was expecting; however, is how FANTASTIC the Nook is after Android is installed on it. A friend of my just bought a new iPad 2 and showed it to me a couple of days ago. That, of course, is a wonderful device but VERY expensive. I started to look around the 'net and found that the latest Android Operating System, Honeycomb, can be installed on a micro-SD memory card and that this will allow the Nook to run the new OS. Even better, by simply removed the micro-SD card, the Nook returns to it's normal state and continues to run as before.I had NO IDEA how powerful the Nook Color really is until I installed Honeycomb on it. The Nook is now so great that it behooves me that B & N doesn't simply place Android on the Nook as the default OS! Yes, it's its that good! Just one word of caution. As using Honeycomb doesn't require that the Nook be rooted, it is a bit tricky to install but that's only due to the HORRIBLE instructions that the geeks who discovered how to put Android on the it. (As a rule, Geeks are usually incapable of writing in known-human languages.) I don't know if the warranty is voided by running Honeycomb but, as all that needs to done to get rid of it, is remove the micro-SD card, I suspect that no one will know.All in all, the Nook Color was already a great device but adding Honeycomb makes it AMAZING!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "All I can say is WOW!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1300665600, "reviewTime": "03 21, 2011"}

However, I got a deal on a Nook Color that was impossible to ignore and so I made the jump. If you're wondering if it's worth 2X the price, IMO it depends on your needs and wants. For people who want to create an inexpensive e-reader/Android tablet by rooting the Nook -- or if you love to read periodicals or books with lots of images -- the Nook Color is the way to go.It's surprisingly heavy to hold -- MUCH heavier than my Kindle with a cover. The battery life means you CAN'T be far away from an electrical plugin. My last charge lasted 2+ days with playing games, an animated screensaver and some reading. It's also wireless only.The backlit LCD screen is spectacular and I find it was better on my eyes for reading than I expected. However, I find that finding ebooks on B&N;'s site is harder than Amazon and I cannot find many inexpensive or the oodles of free ebooks like for Kindle. Lots of ebooks promoted on B&N;'s Nookstore are $4.99 - $9.99 or more. Too expensive, IMO. Seems like fewer Indie Authors on there in the $2.99 price range :(I decided to take a chance and rooted my new Nook Color which requires a micro SD card (I used a 2G card). It requires the ability to follow some technical steps that took me about 15 minutes total. I am not a major Geek, but I've been online for 15 years and know basic stuff like HTML (not needed for this) and moving files and some troubleshooting if I get stuck. The Rooted Nook is a bit quirky. While the original B&N; e-reader functionality is still there, I had to install a couple apps (launcher app and Softkeys) to toggle between the Android and B&N; screens.I CAN watch YouTube and surf the web easily. I also downloaded the Amazon Kindle app to my rooted Nook, and read my 100+ Kindle books on it (and get my freebies too!). You can't view Flash or use Hulu or Netflix (yet!), but maybe flash will work with the next B&N; update. note that a Nook Color doesn't have a mic or bluetooth to use with certain Android apps. A bummer for me because I like to dictate texts and emails on my phone using Nuance's FlexT9 app.Overall, my kids **love** the Android side of the rooted Nook Color, and I like getting some useful apps on a much bigger screen.

The overall product will still be the same, but some things (like the instruction manual) might be different.---------Reading: It's a nice clean picture & the backlit screen isn't too annoying, but I have a feeling that people will be feeling the eyestrain later. If you're looking to buy this for reading at length, you'll need to be aware of this. You can change the brightness of the page, but that doesn't change that ultimately you're still looking at a backlit screen.Downloading: Pretty fast download times, although I only downloaded the free samples from the storefront. (Hilarious since I work at a Books-A-Million & the storefront's B&N.; We're so going to lose money on ebook sales.)Internet: Pretty decent. I pulled up facebook & the page is crisp, clear & loads quickly. I also went onto failblog, a site with quite a few side ads. It was a little on the slow side, but that's to be expected on stuff like this. You can also pull up videos on youtube, so that's a bonus.Battery: Not bad, but obviously won't last as long as the Nook or some of the e-ink units out there. You'll get about 3-4 hours if you leave the wifi on. Not sure about the non-wifi battery life right now, but since the company says it's 8 hours I'd say it's probably about 6-7 hours.Extras: You can change the font, screen background color, & a few other things. While that's nice, I couldn't help but feel a little underwhelmed by it. There's also the option to be able to toggle back & forth between the publisher default & your aesthetics of choice. You can also change the background on the main page of the NookColor, which is a nice touch. Since we're not supposed to change that with our store unit, I wasn't able to play with that any.Touch Screen: It's OK. Pretty easy to use, but a few times I found myself really having to wrestle with it to turn pages. Sometimes it would be too sensitive & I'd end up a few pages ahead of where I wanted to be. Not a deal breaker, though. It didn't happen enough to where I'd get overly irritated, but people who are all thumbs with touch screens will be irritated.User Friendly: It's not very intuitive to use. People savvy with e-readers & gadgets will be able to figure it out pretty quickly but people who are new to the scene will be pretty confused with everything. The unit for my store didn't come with any written directions- it was all on the unit. That means that if it's like this on the sale unit then that won't be all that helpful for the people who aren't able to navigate well on the unit.Overall: My opinion is that it's OK, but not exceptionally so. Go for the iPad if you really want something like this. (I know it's more expensive, but if you're willing to pay $300 then paying $500 might not be that much of a difference.) It's basically a Nook/iPad hybrid, but without the option for all of the extras & apps. (Of course if all you want is an e-reader & wouldn't use the iPad's extras, then this is great.) Overall it isn't a bad unit but it just doesn't have anything to really make it stand out. If you're a big fan of the Nook then go for this unit, but I'd play with it in the store first.The only two things that really make this stand out from the other e-readers on the market is that the unit is in color and that the internet on this unit is far better than some of the other options on the e-reader market. While the color option is great for children's books & magazines, this might not be enough for users who predominantly use their readers for plain print reading & that the ones who would want these things might already have it in the various tablets that are on the market.I did enjoy playing with the unit in my store, but I don't know that I would choose it over the regular Nook. Of course this is just my opinion, but again- before making a big purchase like this, view a unit in the store first.3.9/5", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not bad, but might not sway many users of other readers on the market", "unixReviewTime": 1290729600, "reviewTime": "11 26, 2010"}

If you have no interest in hacking this device, then let me start with the \"stock\" review first.As an eBook reader, it is very good but not great.  eInk and its variants will always be the gold standard by which you measure a reading device, because the utility of such a display in daylight is unrivaled.  My hope is that in time, the Pixel Qi displays make their way into Kindles, Nooks, iPads, etc on such a large scale that this is no longer an issue.  Alas, it remains one, and it is a key criterion for many.  As an LCD touch screen, it is very bright and colors are rich, not saturated.  Touch sensitivity is a little rough, as is accuracy.  I did not see a calibration function.Wireless connectivity is very, very good but for some reason, will not connect with some routers.  The range is impressive, better than my Droid 2.  Speeds are very good, but I neglected a speedtest in this round.Integration with the B&N; store is very tight as expected.  The store app for the Nook is better than the Android app, necessarily: you can browse magazines and newspapers, for one thing.  Display of media is well-formatted and fairly intuitive; I never cracked the user manual or quick start guide (then again, I rarely do that for anything I buy). Prices are competitive with other vendors, and it does handle sideloading of books onto microSD cards.  By the way, 32Gb microSDs are supported.  I run with an 8Gb, and I've filled it mostly with music.And oh by the way, it plays music very well.  Some of you might listen to music while you read, and I am one of those weirdos.  This device, stock, will do just that.  Overall, I like this device, but would probably prefer eInk if I was buying it solely for reading media.However, I bought it for cheap tablet use.  In this regard, it has amazing potential.  Despite the fragmentation of custom ROM and rooting options, you can indeed settle on a Cyanogen ROM and find a lot of functionality on the cheap.  I can browse websites easily if I don't need Flash (currently not working on this ROM); I use PocketCloud to log into my home machines and I can work from there if needed.  I'd love to have Swype on this, or even Graffiti, but it is sufficient to have access to the Android Marketplace and all the attendant apps I have stored in the cloud.  There is no microphone or camera, so those apps have no place here, nor does GPS exist.  However, Bluetooth is available in Cyanogen nightlies so you can now try pairing it with headsets and keyboards.  Thus far, the potential is not fully realized but it perfectly suits my needs today.  With time, this will become a great tablet once Flash is fully operable and the Honeycomb ROMs are fully baked.Stock, 4 stars.

It is not meant to be tablet or an iPad replacement.  It is foremost an e-Reader with some bells and whistles.If I'm given a choice, I would not buy a Nook.  For the price, I would rather get a Kindle Fire.  I own 4 laptops, 1 iPad 2 for my wife, and 3 Kindle Fires for my kids.  Nook Color is an afterthought and it is for me.  I bought my used Nook Color on another site for $114 (free shipping) 2 weeks ago.  And it was a steal.  The Nook I received was in working order and it looked new.I had no trouble turning it on and everything worked perfectly.  The only gripe was it was extremely slow compare to some of the tablets I own.  Again, I reminded myself that this is not a tablet so I had to be fair.  The features are not too bad but the navigation was confusing at best.Fast forward to today.  B&N; was smart to release an update (1.4.1).  If you already own a Nook Color, you should get the update.  The update improves the speed dramatically.  The navigation still lacks finesse though.Here are some of the goods- I bought it cheap- It has an expansion slot.  I inserted a 16GB micro SD card and Nook recognizes it right away.- The web works fine.  It can now even watch some YouTube.  It also runs Flash.  Nook 1, iPad 0.- The new update allows NetFlix to run.- There are some apps that are extremely useful.  I love the Smithsonian Channel and Pulse.- The magazines look great.  The update also improve the navigation.- The interactive books are great.  My daughter absolutely loves it.And now the bads- I constantly look for free stuff.  Unfortunately, B&N; doesn't offer a lot of free books that are worthwhile.- The apps itself, is sad to say the least.  The offering is a fraction of what you can find in iPad and Amazon.  And most of them are costly too.- While the update improve the speed of web-surfing, it still is slower than iPad and Kindle Fire.- The speaker is terrible.  It is located on the back of the device.  If you hold the Nook on your hand, you may cover the speaker. The best solution is to use a head phone.- The navigation overall needs to be improved. It is a basic Android without much thought.  At times I don't even know whether to double-tap or hold to get more options.Here is my final take.  If you are short on cash, and would like a good e-reader/tablet.  Go get a Kindle.  If you can find a Nook for less than $150. Go for it.I would not spend more than $200 on a Nook (be it a Color/Tablet).  There are much better options out there.Update January 24, 2012I have used my Nook for a month now and all in all, I like it because it allows me to read my magazines and books.  It sure beats a 10 incher tablet.  The update 1.4.1 is definitely a must if you want to use Nook Color to its full potential.  However, I found out yesterday that the update was actually used to close the loop on dual-boot and disable any sideload of apps.  The version 1.4.0 allows the Nook to load Amazon app and the Launcher EX.  Basically it allows other apps other than B&N; to be loaded.  The automatic update 1.4.1 disable this option.  So, if you are dare enough to install other apps, you can backdate the version to 1.4.0 if you want to load other apps.Update February, 2012Nook continues to lose to Kindle Fire in terms of contents.  B&N; could not match to the behemoth of Amazon and I don't think it will ever be.  However, if you are stuck with Nook, there are a few apps that you must have (they are all free).  It helps the Nook Color to be a good companion in a boring world.- NetFlix is a must.  7 inch on your lap and plug in a pair of headphones.  You are good to go.- Smithsonian is interesting.  Want to learn something that you forgot.  This app works great but contents updates are slow.- Dolphin Internet Explorer works great for anyone wants to do quick surfing.  Very fast and very convenient.- Don't know what interest you, try Stumbleupon.  It randomly pulls internet content based on your interest.  Works great on YouTube vidoes.- Good with words, try Nook Crossword.- Who doesn't use Dropbox.  It is a must.- Springpad is great to jot down quick notes.- Pandora works great too, but you need a pair of headphones though.- Who needs newspaper when you have Pulse.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not a bad product and close to being perfect", "unixReviewTime": 1323820800, "reviewTime": "12 14, 2011"}

I probably won't root it because for my wife's purposes it pretty much does everything she needs, but it can be rooted and used as a full fledged Android tablet.  I really like this device.

Emerson", "helpful": [10, 10], "reviewText": "EDIT - Update 1.4.1 (12/21/2011): BIG update rolled out on December 14th, with lots of big changes, most of which really improved the device.First, the \"n\" key, which originally functioned as a home key taking you back to the original home screen, now functions as the menu key instead, like on the new Nook Tablet. Prior, there was a softkey arrow that would bring up the menu function, and Barnes and Noble has moved that function to strictly hardware. I'm torn about whether I like this update, because honestly, I don't like relying just on a hardware key for something like a menu, especially with the issues I've had with Nook parts (I've owned two cords in the past year alone.) It does makes multi-taking easier, when switching from one application to another (say reading to internet), because you don't have to go to the home menu function first. For those of us Nook Color originals, it takes adjusting from old habits, but so far, it's not a bad change.The reader application functions in a much more friendly manner. The page numbers are on the bottom of the pages, instead of the top, in a much less chintzy font, and pulling up the menu tell you how many more pages are left in the chapter. Not really a necessary change, but kind of nice. There are some fonts added, along with FINALLY adding the option to change the tone of the page from white to sepia, night, or off-white. The books also read sideways now, in a two-page fashion, though I'll admit, I don't use that much, and won't, even with the ability to have it on something other than kids books. Just makes the actual reader app a much more rounded and friendly one.The magazine reader had a few changes that are nice. There are animations for the page turns now (though why they don't have that option with the books is a big of an in-congruency), though the animations disappear when you zoom in. The menu at the bottom pulls up the pages in miniature picture form, but are in a much more appealing, accessible manner. Rather Mac-esque, really. Nothing huge, but it makes it all more friendly-looking. Randomly, the magazine reading app is the only one where the \"n\" button is still a home button, and not a menu one. Wondering if they'll notice that and change it in the future.The PDF reader had some AWESOME changes. Before, reading PDF files was incredibly clunky, and did not resolve well on the screen at all. Reading a book involved zooming in and scrolling down, instead of sideways like the ereader application, and when you closed the PDF file, reopening would take you right back to page one, and never saved your last place. Ridiculously cumbersome, and not user-friendly at all. The new update not only saves your place, but it resolves the page so that the text fits better on the screen, and allows the pages to read much more easily sideways. It also scrolls sideways, instead of down, which just makes sense and follows with the overall expectations of the reading experience.Interestingly, enough, they still haven't resolved the issue of PDF files not having a cover when on the home screen or in the menu, even when the information is attached, which is something I was hoping they'd resolve. It's not a huge issue, but it's just a visual annoyance when all the EPUB files have cool graphics show up on the home screen, and PDF files just have grey with the title of the book. Lame.Overall performance of the menu functions and flipping between tasks seems zippier than it was before, and I really appreciate that. The menu functions seem much more efficient and smooth, and that just makes for a much better interaction.The ebook store also changed around, and B&N; completely reordered all the categories and changed the look. I can't say I appreciate all the changes they made, because you can no longer organize things like apps or books based on price, and instead have to search manually in the menu. I'm frugal, I'll admit. I miss the ability to find free apps easily, because let's face it, it just makes me happy.Overall, I love the update they rolled out, though! It's nice to know that B&N; is staying loyal to their original customers and keeping the devices updated.*  *  *EDIT 4/12/2011: Barnes and Noble did an update recently which fixed the glitches with the screen when plugged in, finally. I have not had any issues with the screen lagging or glitching since.*  *  *EDIT 2/28/2011: A new update now allows for Android apps and email on the Nook, which is exciting. I'm not all that into the apps they have, especially the games, but it's a nice touch! It has also fixed the issue of not being able to put your own books on the home screen, and the issue that the Nook was having with recognizing cover art for those books. I can now also put other apps on the home screen, such as the Email or Pandora app, which gives the entire thing a much freer, most customizable feel. Though apparently this update has cancelled out the last one, because the screen glitches when plugged in are back. Oh, well, I'm just happy to now be able to put my own books on my own home screen! Vast improvement right there!*  *  *Original review, from 12/2010:I received my Nook Color as a gift for an early Christmas, and have been using it for a few weeks now, enough time that I decided I can make an educated review.Pros/Cons-It has a great screen, with sharp resolution. Book title colors and wallpapers look sharp and clear, and the touchscreen is responsive. You can adjust the brightness, though I rarely found the need to adjust the brightness even a quarter of what it could be, since otherwise it was a bit too bright on the eyes. That being said, I found that when you plug it in to a power source and try and use it, the touchscreen goes crazy, and won't even perform simple tasks like unlocking the device. You can't flip to the next screen without several swipes, and turning pages can be a haphazard activity. That weird glitch doesn't affect the device at all when it isn't connected to a power source, but it's such a pain when the device is low on battery power and you want to read while it's charging.-The hardware on the Nook Color is nice, with a muted metallic finish on the front and back, which gives it a nice grip, though I immediately bought a cover, so the fact that it's somewhat grippy doesn't matter much any longer. The weight is nice, about the weight of a small hardcover book, which I found rather pleasant when holding. I still don't get the random open-hole thing in the lower left-hand corner, though. It's like you're supposed to use that to clip the device onto something, but I hardly thing someone is going to just clip it onto their keychain for convenience. It's clearly not awful-looking, but I guess it just seems kind of superfluous to me. Oh, well.-The battery life is surprisingly good. I don't have to WiFi on when I'm at home, and the device will go for several days on low-brightness. I actually had it on one charge for about 7 days one time, and was pretty impressed, considering other devices with LCD features tend to eat battery life like some kids eat Cocoa Puffs.-It's Android-based, which is great. However, B&N; doesn't allow any apps from the Android market, which is such a crime, considering that the tablet could be a fantastic tool if B&N; would open up the gates on that one. The fact that it's Android-based isn't really a selling point, it's more of a potential point to keep an eye on, one that hopefully the company will do more with down the road. The tablet does come with certain apps like Pandora and games like Sudoku, which will do in a pinch if you're bored.-It comes WiFi enabled, and it connects to networks easily and without issues. It does recognize B&N; WiFi hot-spots, and remembers them, which means that you don't have to reprogram the networks or worry about not being able to access the in-store features, which is really convenient. The browser is pretty decent, doesn't have flash, but performs very well. I actually used it for emails and checking my Facebook when I was out of town, and it was snappy and quick, though the fact that it doesn't have pinch/pull zooming features (which the picture gallery does, oddly enough) is a bit of a turn-off, because it can make browsing somewhat clunky and inaccurate.-The B&N; store they have on the device is convenient, loads content easily, and is very user-friendly to navigate. Once you have your information in, downloads are quick and easy, and you can also set a password for downloads, to prevent someone downloading books without approval. Also, if you have a gift card for B&N;, you can use it to buy books, but you have to go online to your account first, and save the information on your account before it'll charge it, and it'll always charge to that card first before your credit card, which is a pretty cool feature.-The reader itself is awesome, and you can sideload your EPUB files easily onto the device from your computer and start reading them immediately. You can't, however, read PUB files like you can on a regular Nook, which I found obnoxious, since I have a lot of eBooks in that format (that are from a B&N; affiliated website, no less). You also can't put files that HAVEN'T been downloaded directly from the B&N; store on the device over WiFi onto your home screen, so in order to pull up your own personal files sideloaded onto the device (even ones downloaded directly from B&N; online), you have to go into the Bookshelf menu and go from there. Which means that if you don't have WiFi all the time (as I do), very few of your books will be able to be put on your home screen, which is such a childish thing for B&N; to do, really. It takes away the personalization that the tablet could do so well, and bothered the heck out of me when I first discovered it. Granted, you could probably fix it by rooting the device, but you run the risk of other issues in the software when you do that, so hopefully B&N; will come out with an update to fix that annoyance.-The Nook does read PDF files, but it's a very awkward process, since the screen ratio doesn't fit the allotted size, making the text tiny and incomprehensible, so trying to reads books in that format is a headache; zooming in is awkward and clunky, and takes to long to be worth the effort. Also, closing and reopening the file takes you back to the first page, which, if you're attempting to read an extensive document in several sittings, gets really old really fast. If you have book in PDF form, I would suggest downloading something like Calibre and converting them to EPUB to save yourself the trouble.-Music loads and plays easily, though I honestly haven't used that feature much, since I have an iPod, and if I want a playlist, I go from there. Pictures also load easily, though you have to have it in the gallery/grid feature to see previews, otherwise they are just displayed with file type images until you click on them to open. Silly little issue, but again, something B&N; will hopefully fix in the future.Anyway, great product, but really, more potential than actual greatness at this point. I love the fact that I don't have to leave the house to read a book, which is great since I'm at home with an infant all the time. Is it worth the money? If you buy it directly from B&N; online, it's $249, which isn't an awful price for touchscreen reader (it's really only about $100 more than a regular Nook or Kindle), so I would say that yes, it is. It's just still somewhat disappointing that it feels like it's half-finished, but I'm looking forward to see where it all goes from here.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Some quirks B&N needs to work out, but otherwise, great reading device", "unixReviewTime": 1293408000, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2010"}

I just bought this Nook color tablet from Best Buy two days ago,  It's perfect.  After charging it, I drove straight to Barnes & Noble books to try their wifi and buy a few books. TRUST ME, THE Barnes & Noble bookstore employees know how to operate the Noook, and did a better job than Best Buy, at showing me how to use the Nook and answer my questions.  The set up and navigation is easy, and the user settings are user friendly. When reading books, I found that the bright white background screen was hurting my eyes.  So I lowered the brightness level down to half of the default setting.  Yes, you can adjust the brightness as well as the volume.  Nice Browser: when using the browser, it accesses the internet very quick.  While using the wifi in the B&N store, I accessed Hulu plus (The video website).  I was in the Barnes & noble store watching an episode of Law & Order.  HOW COOL IS THAT?  The weight is a little haavy in your hand when reading books, but no where near as heavy as the Kindle Fire.  The kindle fire was both thick & too heavy.  On the kindle fire's screen, I had to fight & tap several times to change screens. I grew frusrtated, took the kindle back to Best Buy the same day, and exchanged it for the Nook.  I'm so glad I did.  On the nook, changing screens only requires a smooth tap.

Chaika \"book, movie, tech lover\"", "helpful": [16, 20], "reviewText": "I have been down and up with this reader for the past 5 months, but since April, it has been a joy.  B&N; has gotten its act together.  The problem I had with not being able to open books has been solved. B&N; not only finally found out what caused some books to lock up but also how to restore them.  There is no longer any problem with opening any books.When I first bought my reader, the tech support people were not well-trained. They are now.  I have 80 books on it and no problems with any of them.Now, the goodies:  B&N; just introduced Enhanced Editions of some books. These have videos, audio clips, animated maps, etc.embedded in the text.  It's wonderful.  I'm reading D-Day, and throughout there are newsreel segments pertinent to the text.  For instance, you read about Eisenhower and then play the video of him talking to his troops before they embark for the Normandy Coast.  You don't just read about bombing or fighting,you hear and see as well. It's a whole new reading experience and available only on the NOOKcolor (or the iPad with the NOOK app.)Pictures in magazines like National Geographic are gorgeous.  They look better than the print versions. There is a selection of apps for the NOOKcolor, with more coming out all the time.However, if you want all the Android apps, then  you can get an N2A SD card on Amazon that turns your NOOKcolor into a full Android tablet with access to the Market. You then  have the option of booting the reader up as a NOOKcolor or an Android Tablet.  You can even get a Kindle App so you can get and read books from Kindle on your NOOKcolor.Some people say that the backlit screen has glare and that you can't read it outdoors.  Not true.  I read my NOOKcolor in my sunny back yard all the time, and, although I'm a 76 year old lady, I can read for hours on it with no problem.Now for the goodies besides the Enhanced Editions.  You can get an app that allows you to work on Office documents on your reader.  Downloading files, pictures, and music is a breeze.The NOOK also allows you to borrow ebooks from public libraries.  All you need is a library card.  Libraries all over the US are lending ebooks.  So, you don't have to buy all the books you want to read.  That's a big saving. And, it takes less than a minute to download a  book.  You just connect your reader with a USB cord and Adobe Digital Editions displays the books you've borrowed & you drag the ones you want to the My NOOKcolor shelf.  As with Kindle, there is also a Lend Me feature so that your friends can borrow from you.The touch screen is very sensitive and I'm very clumsy, so it took me awhile to be able to navigate easily, rapidly, and without bringing up unwanted menus.  But that was true of the iPhone when I got my first one,Why don't I go all the way  and give this 5 stars?  Because the device doesn't have a \"sync to farthest point read\" feature, so if you decide to look at an earlier page,the only way to get back is to use this awkward slider bar.  I can never get it to stop at just the page I want.  The same is true of clicking on endnotes.  When you're through reading them, you have to navigate backwards to the text. There is a Back button displayed on the Notes page, but it disappears before you can read your note.  B&N; has some work to do on this.In sum, if you buy it at Barnes and Noble, the NOOKcolor is only $249, half the price of the cheapest iPad or even Android Tablets.  Yet, for $39.95 more you can get the card to turn it into a full Android Tablet.  It is incredibly more versatile than the Kindle. Page turning is smoother than on the Kindle--or am I the only one who sees the afterimage of the page you're going from while you're turning pages on the Kindle?  On the NOOKcolor, like the iPad, you just touch and you're  on the next page.One other thing: naturally, a touch screen will get smudged.  B&N; says to wipe it with a dry microfiber cloth.  I found that didn't clean it enough.  If the screen isn't clean, it can get jumpy.  So, knowing that the iPhone has a capacitative touch screen as does the NOOKcolor, I tried using the products sold in the Apple Store to clean the screen.  They work perfectly.As mentioned in my earlier review, I also like the NOOKcolor feature of your being able to share a passage with a friend without leaving the page you're reading.  Also, I find the Web browser is just fine. In fact, when I'm  reading and see a name or word I need more info on, I just touch it and when the popup appears, I choose Wikipedia or Google and surf to my heart's content. Then I just touch the \"book\" icon on the lower screen and I'm back to the page I was reading.  It's smooth and fast.I belong to Goodreads and when I'm through with a book, I can just go to the Goodreads app on my NOOKcolor and post my review immediately.

More importantly, I wanted something that would allow me to highlight and take notes on passages. Finally, if the physical copy of a book had pictures in it, I wanted to be able to see those pictures on my E-Reader.WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE NOOK:--One of the first things to attract me to the Nook was its simplicity. There are only 4 buttons to be seen: A power button, Volume Up, Volume Down and the Nook \"Menu\" button. The buttons are inconspicuous and don't protrude.--I was able to download almost all of the books I was looking for from the B&N; shop. To be fair, some of the stuff I read is relatively obscure.--I like the ability to highlight passages with different colors and take notes.--I like that it shows pictures from books.--Although it wasn't something I was looking for at the start of my E-Reader search, I found that I liked the built-in games (Chess, Sudoku, Crossword puzzles, etc).--Finally, the touchscreen is pretty responsive (not perfect) and the menus are mostly intuitive.A FEW THINGS I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE NOOK:--As mentioned earlier, the touchscreen is good, but not perfect. It can be really touchy and trying if you're trying to get a certain passage highlighted. Even more difficult is trying to navigate web pages using the browser. I don't recommend the Nook as a Netbook or iPad replacement, but it is nice if all you use it for is downloading more books or reading some online news.--Pictures from physical books sometimes show up on the Nook version of the book. When they do (like maps in fantasy novels) they are usually much, much smaller. Unfortunately all the Nook books I've seen don't allow you to resize or zoom in on these maps or pictures.OVERALL:For the most part, the Nook met my initial requirements. Some things I didn't think I'd use much before (Chess, etc) I actually use fairly often and will come in handy to pass away the time on a long plane flight or layover.If you want something that will just read books, then I'm sure you can find something better.

Anyway, I was very dissapointed at this iteration of the Nook.First off, the Nookcolor is very heavy.  I think it's almost 1 pound, and since it's not a true tablet, you're supposed to hold it in one hand, but it'll strain your hand muscles after a few minutes.  Even the B&N; guy told me to hold it with TWO hands. That's pretty pathetic, I must say. The only way to use it for more than a few minutes is to pop it up on some support, which obviously is not convenient for a device that's primarily an e-book reader.Second, even though it's much faster than 1st- and 2nd-generation Nooks, it is still slow, especially when browsing the web.  Now, page turns are generally faster, but there is no animation, and sometimes there *is* a slight delay so you're never sure if the device registered your turn gesture.  Very annoying.Third, the screen is high-res but rather poor in contrast and viewing angles.  I think the resolution is 1024x600, and the DPI is in the high 100's, but overall I felt the screen looked coarse.  I guess for this price, they have to pick some cheapo screen, so no surprise there.  The color LCD screen, of course, draws down battery pretty quick, a fact even the B&N; staff acknowledges readily.  Also, the screen is completely unreadable under direct sunlight.Speaking of the screen, the digitizer is not very responsive, whether you want to zoom in or out or type something.  It's slightly better than my 4th-gen iPod touch but that's still a very frustrating experience.Fourth, the software is still buggy.  The demo unit in store had a few books, but half of them could not open, with some mysterious error message.  The web browser could not render several web sites I tried.Fifth, the interface is very confusing.  There is the hard nook button, there is some kind of drawer button on the screen.  After an hour I still found myself tapping the wrong button to do something.  Very dumb.Sixth, of course, you cannot access the Android Marketplace app store, at least without jailbreaking this.  Very few apps are available and there is no indication B&N; will allow more aps, since they wnat to use this sell e-books, which carry fat margins and have super-enriched Amazon and its founder.In short, this is a disappointing device, not the least because its hefty weight and barely useable screen are just ridiculous for an e-book reader.The list price is $249.99 and B&N; does offer a 30-day money back guarantee if you buy it from them.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Heavy, slow, poor screen, buggy", "unixReviewTime": 1291334400, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2010"}

There have been plenty of books that by their cover (yes i judge) and short summary I would've bought but because of my ability to skim the book in store I have decided not to buy.Similarly there are some great books out there but for photography and coffee table type books, you really can't experience them the same way with a nook or an ipad.

There is a fair amount of eyestrain associated with reading on a backlit display but I had no problems reading for well over 2 hours on it. The font was just as clear and easy to read as on my ipad.Size wise it is not much different than the original nook but is much heavier.It is lighter and easier to carry than the ipad because of its dimensions.In the end I did not buy this product to read on it, I bought it to root and use android honeycomb on it.This makes the this the best value out of any reader on the market in my opinion.The nook has virtually the same specs as the Samsung galaxy tab aside from the 3g.at $250 (buy directly from B&N;) you cannot complain, Honeycomb runs smooth and opens up an entire world of possibilitiesfor this little tablet.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nook for an Amazon Lover?!", "unixReviewTime": 1300320000, "reviewTime": "03 17, 2011"}

Don't touch it while reading or  1. a menu pops up for things like brightness settings, text size, highlighting, dictionary, share options, find button, content button & a slider to zip to a page quickly or;  2. the page might turn, or  3. the page will scroll vertically or horizontally.  You MUST hold the device by the margins outside the glass.

Although it's a bit weird to be writing a review of it on Amazon, I felt that potential Kindle purchasers should understand their options.The Nook Color is, by far, the best eReader I've used (including the iPad). It's not perfect, but it almost is. The LCD screen is very easy to read, which surprised me since I was a big fan of e-ink and did not like long-term reading on the iPad. The lack of need for a night light is great, and the software it ships with is lightning fast and almost bug-free. Really, there is no lag when I'm using it and the functionality (once you spend 3 minutes learning it) is near-perfect.BN is quickly catching up to Amazon on content...frankly don't notice a difference anymore. Plus, you can side-load eBooks from Google and elsewhere.I know this...I will never go back to e-ink again and love this screen.I also LOVE the delivery of magazines on this thing. Really, it's better than the real magazine. You get full color reproduction of text and pics, and it gives you an Article View if you just want to read the article. It is a great way to get magazines and will be better as they get more publishers (right now, it's a decent list but it could be better).I also really like the multimedia support...I can load photos and pics on an Micro SD card and take my music with me. If I'm in a wifi area, I get full Pandora support! I wish it had 3G, but this is still great.Having said that, the Color is not perfect. First off, the weight, while acceptable, is SLIGHTLY too much. It won't cause strain like the iPad and is perfectly capable of being read in bed (you can lock out the gyro so the book doesn't flip Portrait=>Landscape), but it's not the unnoticeable weight of the Nook or Kindle (or paperback). Still way better than a hardcover though.Second, the screen, while great, is slightly tactile, not glass like you would be used to on an iPhone or high-end Android phone...this is nitpicky, but I noticed it.Third, no Flash support yet (and, while it is a great web-browser, it's not a laptop, iPad, or even like my HTC Evo). This, and the lack of pinch-zoom multi-touch, affects my enjoyment of the web brower (note: you can zoom, just not pinch-zoom). UPDATE: Pinch Zoom is here! It's very good, but not great, implementation. Makes the browser that much better!Fourth, the newspaper delivery, while acceptable and similar to the original Nook/Kindle, is not good enough. Frankly, it's easier to read the web pages of the papers than on this and pales in comparison to the magazine delivery, which really is SUPERB!Finally, and most importantly, is the battery. This is not like an e0ink reader. To give you an idea, the other day, I started out with a full charge and I read around 600 pages of a book and did some light browsing. I did not use music or Pandora and did not pay any games. At the end of the day, I had to charge it again. This was about 7 or 8 hours of use. That's OK with me but it ain't the type of thing that you can go on a three day road trip without your chord like the Kindle or original Nook.Anyway, it looks like my cons are longer than the pros, but really, this is a great product.

It is an ok device but does not truly shine as an ereader and I will expand on it shortly.1st, this is more a hybrid device than an ereader. An ereader basically is for reading documents in an electronic format. Examples of good ereaders: Kindle (of course), Nook 1st generation and Sony. Nook Color, besides allowing you to read, let you browse internet, listen music, play some games and much more tablet oriented stuff. Of course, there is nothing wrong on that until you start thinking about how important color and internet are for just reading a simple book.So, what's cool or nice:-Internet.Full color internet experience, with nice virtual keyboard and ok browser. Touching the screen and keyboard is like an iPad or similar tablets, but is comfortable enough for short emails or using Wikipedia or Google.-PDF supportWith Nook Color not only you can read PDFs in a nice full color screen but you can expand or zoom in at will, move along pages with a simple touch or even rotate and read in landspace mode. This feature is really amazing and the selling point if reading PDFs is your only or most important task.-Full color screenPretty obvious. If you like magazines or would like to get electronic subscriptions of any of them, look no further. The resolution, colors and screen is perfect, a real pleasure to read using a NC. Depending of the magazine you can also extract or read the text or article portion only, leaving images apart.BUT!... not everything is perfect ...-No landscape mode for booksYou have landscape mode while reading PDFs but not while reading regular ePub books. This was a real surprise to me, a bad one! Landscape mode allows you to rotate and read poetry or technical books without cutting the paragraph or breaking lines. With no Landscape mode you are forced to read every book \"as is\" and for a hybrid table which costs more than $200.00, in my opinion, it is not acceptable. My Kindle 3 rotates and it's 50% cheaper!-LCD screenI must admit this device has less glare issues than iPad or Galaxy, but if you have read using eink technology you would not go back and change to LCD again. Reading on a Nook Color for several hours is not easy for your eyes. And forget about using it at your pool or outdoors, unless is cloudy or you find the perfect angle; the glare will bother you while reading anyway. Indoor is a different story but it created some eye strain on me anyway, specially after long reading sessions.-HeavyFor serious readers (those who read novels, fiction books, technical books) or more than 2 or 3 weeks per month, please think again before buying. With about 18oz your hands and wrist will start complaining soon and if you don't have a desk or something to put your NC on, your choices are using your tummy, chest, lap or knee as additional support. A deal breaker. Being a Kindle 3 owner I know what I'm talking about. You can hold a Kindle 3 with one hand and read for hours with little or no problems at all.-BatteryOnly 8 hrs of continue use, average. I bought it a Tuesday, read for about 5 hrs that day, went to bed (leave it on but in sleeping mode). Next day morning turned it on, used it 1 more hour and soon after that the device was at 16% of battery life. (I barely used internet and brightness was at minimum) Another important point about battery and charge is that the Nook Color must be charged via wall, not USB or computer unless screen is off, which means you must forget about using the device during the charging process. The adapter is also proprietary so you can't use your Nook 1st gen adapter or the one some Androids use, I don't like that, I don't like proprietary stuff. The more standard, the more common, the better to replace or find.-No zoom or ability to enlarge imagesAn image with wrapping text around in that cool book? If you can't read it or maybe is too small, then sorry...you're out of luck. You have (at the moment of this review) no way to click, expand or enlarge that image. If you read mostly novels this means nothing to you. But if you read technical books with some images or illustrations on it, the size will be so small that is basically useless and not readable at all. I can't believe this simple feature is absent and I can only hope for a future fix via firmware-Android based but not full access to Android marketShame on you B&N.; This device could be a real hit if was not so closed or locked. As usual, this device will be hacked for those with brave hearts or basic computer skills (actually, it has been) but warranty will not be honored and it's a hassle to keep it up to date after official B&N; firmware upgrades, in case you hacked or rooted the device; also you won't be able to read books in-store if you root it. While B&N; keeps selling the unit without Android Market or a restricted version of it, this device will be like having a Magnum revolver in your hands without any bullets. So much power with Android/Linux but you just can't use it.-No \"read me\" featureFor a $200.00 tablet, I would expect this feature. The Kindle it's not so powerful in terms of hardware or processor and it reads the English books for you.SummaryIf you read a lot, portability and battery life are important for you, forget about Nook Color. If you are a casual reader, looking for a fun device and distractions (Internet, Games, etc) Nook color will fit your bill. Just keep in mind that Nook Color is not a true ereader though, but more like a tablet with reading abilities; if you are aware of that and eye strain is not a concern, this can be a great buy.For now, I will pass. My Kindle 3 is simpler and lighter and does very good what it suppose to do: let me read (or read for me) my favorite books. Most novels and technical books are not in color so I don't need a tablet with Internet access to enjoy them, why bother then?", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good for casual reading.

Peplinski", "helpful": [383, 393], "reviewText": "Last year my husband asked me if I wanted a Kindle, because I love to read all the time and I try to be eco-friendly when possible.  I was intrigued, but my biggest weakness is magazines and I didn't like the availability or look of them on the Kindle.  When the iPad came out, I was blown away by the beauty of it, but felt like for a few dollars more I could just get a whole new laptop and it would be almost the same size.  For travel, the iPad seemed to big and fragile for me; I need to be able to jam all my toys into my backpack and not worry about them.When I stumbled onto the Nook Color, I absolutely flipped my wig and couldn't wait to get one!  Full color magazines, that look just like they do on the newsstand!  This could single-handedly save the rain forests - I seriously buy a LOT of magazines.  I also save them forever because you never know when you might want that one article or photo again, which drives my husband crazy.  So perhaps the Nook Color can save my marriage as well!  That's a lot of expectation to put on this adorable little device, but I think it's up to the challenge.Santa decided to come early to our house, so I just started playing with the NC a few days ago, and it is my first e-reader.  It was almost fully charged right out of the box, so I was able to start playing with it in less than an hour (it says you can use it while it is plugged in, but they keypad is VERY oversensitive when plugged in so I don't recommend it).  It easily connected to my home wifi and linked to the Barnes & Noble account I had set up earlier that day.  If you don't have home wifi, you might have to visit a public wifi location in order to activate it.  I recommend setting up a B&N; account beforehand if you intend to purchase anything from there, as it makes the first-time Nook use very smooth and enjoyable.BOOKS: There are many many books available from a variety of online sources, check the product details for formats (please note it does NOT support Kindle format).  I understand it's also easy to download books from your local public library, though I haven't tried that yet.  The B&N; Shop function within the Nook itself is the easiest interface but certainly not the only option.  While reading, it's very easy to adjust the font, screen brightness, and more to make it as comfortable as possible on the eyes.  At night I turn the brightness all the way down and find it very comfortable for my eyes while reading in bed.  I've read for hours on end without any sort of headache.  I haven't used the highlight, look-up, or share functions very much yet, but they're super easy to incorporate if you enjoy that sort of thing.  Page turning is an intuitive flip of the finger, or you can tap the side of the screen to move forward or back.CHILDREN'S BOOKS: The color on these looks amazing, and the \"read to me\" feature is wonderful for little ones learning to read on their own.  I imagine this would be great fun for a kid stuck in the back seat of a car for a long trip too!  There aren't a ton of Read to Me books available yet but they are adding more every week.  I don't even have kids but these are pretty awesome.MAGAZINES: Obviously this was a major feature for me!  The appearance of the magazines is absolutely gorgeous, the text and photos are clear and sharp.  You can use the \"finger pinch\" method on the touchscreen to zoom in and out, or you can use the \"Article View\" feature to pull out just the text of each page at a pleasant reading size.  The magazine includes every single page that you'd find on the newsstand, including advertisements, which to me is a benefit because I sometimes enjoy the photography and trends those provide.  Magazines can be read in portrait or landscape format, and you can flip through thumbnails at the bottom of the page to reach a particular article.  Most of the currently available magazines offer a single-issue purchase or a 14-day free trial, then bill you monthly for as long as you want to receive issues.  Subscriptions are very easy to manage so canceling is not complicated.  So far there are about 80 magazines available, and the number seems to be increasing regularly.NEWSPAPERS and PDF's: I haven't tried these yet, though some have reported formatting that make certain ones difficult to read.  The ones purchased directly through the Nook store are more likely to be formatted appropriately for the device and easier to read.  Better PDF support is likely to come in a future firmware update, though a lot of it depends on how the original publisher sets up the file.INTERNET: You do need a wifi connection to go online; 3G is unlikely to be available for the Nook Color unless you also purchase an accompanying data plan.  So far most web pages look crisp and beautiful, but are not as fully functional as on a laptop or computer.  Flash functionality is not available yet (but is planned) and a lot of people are experiencing difficulty with email and other text box typing.  I believe this will be fixed very soon, but for now the web is more of a \"read-only\" experience.MUSIC: You can load your own music or use the included Pandora app to link to your Pandora account.  The speaker isn't great so headphones would come in handy.  I'm extremely in love with my new iPod Nano so I will probably strap that on while reading rather than use this feature.VIDEO: Our first try produced some choppy playback, but I think the processor was very busy setting up the hardware because we had just gotten it out of the box.  After that, it played everything perfectly with jaw-dropping video quality!  It will play videos in MP4 format, so get yourself a converter and a microSD card and load it up for your next trip!  Apparently videos can also be side-loaded through the mini-USB cord.  I've only tried it on the card; it reads directly from the card with no problems.OTHER: You can add your own photos to use as background, or just to show friends.  It comes pre-loaded with a few games (sudoku, crossword, and chess) which work well and are fun.  \"Lend Me\" is an exclusive feature that allows you to swap books with other Nook users, and you can find groups of folks online who will swap with you if none of your friends have a Nook.  It uses the android operating system, and an app store is scheduled to open sometime in early 2011 so there will be much much more available in the coming months.I'm the type of person who doesn't need my phone to be a camera, my iPod to be a dvd player, or my e-reader to be a laptop.  The Nook Color does a WONDERFUL job as an e-reader of not only books, but also magazines and newspapers, and it has some other fun bells and whistles.  It does what it's supposed to do very well and the additional features make it a great value for the price.

The color nook is an excellent reading machine, much better than either the Kindle or the e-ink B&W nook. Using the color Nook is totally intuitive with only a few positive surprises at some unexpected capabilities. The battery life is around 8 hours, so you will need to have your special recharging cord, which comecolor s with the Nook, handy. There are small imperfections in the Nook operating system that will get corrected as Barnes and Noble releases updates. The same was true with the Kindle and B&W Nook when first released. The key to a good reading experience with the color Nook is to turn the brightness down, way down. That way eye fatigue is minimal, similar to the e-ink B&W readers with similar brightness. Even with the brightness down, the contrast is excellent and the letters clear. When browsing the web, you might want to turn the brightness up a bit to beautifully display all those colors. The web browser is excellent. It works for email, especially Google mail.  The trick with the power limitations is to keep the brightness down when using the Nook as a reader and turn the internet off. Only turn the internet on when browsing or shopping. That way, when you put it down at night, the power level will be the same in the morning as it was when you went to sleep. Costing only $249 (Dec 2010) at Barnes and Noble, it's affordable and useful, especially if you travel.  The minus 1 star is for the few little glitches in the 1.0 operating system (based on Android 2.2), for the 8 hour battery life, and for the current lack of Apps.

BN literally buries the Android OS under a very thick custom UI and turns off many Android features.  This thick customized layer is what make the NC a great eReader, but a not so great a tablet. So while it is locked down, it does what its meant to do very well.One CAN get to non-BN eBooks in either the ePub or Adobe PDF format. Either format works, looks, and reads very well, easily as good as the best the market has to offer in terms of an eBook reading app.  The fact that BN chooses to bury the location of the downloaded non-BN content AND prevents one from creating shortcuts to either the book file or folder, placing said free books on the book shelf, or even listing them in your list of books is an annoyance to the tolerant and tech savvy.  To non-techies and those less tolerant of mucking about with a gadget, e.g., Grandma, it'd be a showstopper.  But then again, would such a user even KNOW how to get to free eBooks?Movies, again well-hidden in the file system, look great, but BN has capped the max resolution below the abilities of the screen AND the stock player is finicky about format.  For instance, my ripped for iPod Touch movies play fine.  My ripped for Droid Incredible movies aren't playable.  This despite both are MV4 files with AAC soundtracks.  The latter are higher resolution and bit rate so that's the issue.  Again, annoying, but not a real problem.The web browser is just fine.  Pretty much a stock Android browser so fast enough, compatible enough messing around, but if I were going to really do some research, I'd use my computer.With Android 2.2 coming in January, and a BN 'approved' Android market, it'll be an amazingly capable tablet for the money.And that is what one has to remember, it's an exceptional value given the hardware (fast processor/GPU combination, GREAT IPS LCD screen with better color/resolution then an iPad), 512MB RAM, expandable storage, great build quality), and has the best eReader app bar none.  Once Android 2.2 is added with some access to at least a few other apps like email, better browser, and a more format flexible music/video player the value will be simply unassailable...at the price.Pros:Great screen - overall looks, color quality, text quality, adjustabilityeReader UIMagazine format is excellentNewspaper and magazine subscriptions are month to monthBuild qualityIndustrial design - it actually sit flat on a table unlike the iWobleMicroSD supportForm factor - fits MANY of the now discontinued or about to be discontinued Amazon Kindle 2 cases!Battery life (for such a lightweight LCD based device in its size range)Full Android experience just a hack awayUnderlying processor/GPU/RAM is quite powerful though not tops, but more then capable of moving to Android 2.2 and possibly even GingerbreadCan read library eBooks if your local library carries themCons:THICK BN UI if you really want the tablet partsUI takes a few minutes to learnBluetooth not enabled (though it may be Bluetooth ready)No microphone (and therefore no Skype down the road unless the headphone jack can be used like early generation iPod Touches)Will need to hack if the BN Nook Market does not have what you want in terms of appsBN prices their books too highBN magazine subscriptions can be high, though some are a good valueNo camerasRecommended to the magazine/newspaper reader especially.

This isn't an e-ink screen, if that is what you are looking for, go with (a) the original nook, (b) the kindle, or (c) any of the other e-ink dedicated e-readers on the market.This iteration of the nook is marketed towards certain select categories of readers:-The Magazine reader-Students with text books that have graphics-Childrens' books with lots of pictures-Comic book readersIf you notice, these are categories of readers that benefit from the ability of the reader to handle color graphics, which is something e-ink can't yet do!PRICEFor the price, you are getting an android tablet with limited functionality, though, with some technical knowledge, it is possible to unlock this device to be able to fully take advantage of the android market (though it may void your warranty, so do it at your own risk).  Similarly sized android tablets go for prices starting at double the price of the nook color, but they come with full functionality.  Another device this has been compared to is the iPad- which runs at about twice the price as well for the very base model.  On the price point, you are definitely getting a decent deal, though, you are sacrificing some of the functionality for the the reduced cost.Also note, you are not getting 3G access or any other cellular service to access the market- unlike the original nook, that came with the free mobile access to be able to make purchases from the nook market on the go.  The likely reason for the lack of mobile access is due to the fact that this device runs a lot faster and features a full web browser- this increases the speed and easy of the user to access web content- which would be undesirable to any phone service that hosts access because it would reduce the service that their paying customers get.  Instead of mobile data service, users have the option of accessing the BN market and the full internet through wireless.  With today's cell phone technology, many phones are able to be set up as wireless hotspots that users can use to get access on the go- when they are away from their home network.  Overall, this isn't a big deal to me, but I am sure some original nook users depend on that free mobile service to get access to the BN market, so this would be a draw back for you for sure.WEIGHTHonestly, this device does run a little on the heavy side, however, I do believe that it is slightly lighter than it's predecessor.  Still, for the e-reader market, it is heavy.  For the tablet market, it is a little more reasonable.  The weight is a sacrifice, but as long as you aren't trying to read while laying on your back, you should be ok.USER FRIENDLINESS AND EXTRA FEATURESI find this device to be quite simple almost immediately.  Every function that I have looked for has been where I expect it to be and everything has worked smoothly for me.  The page controls while you read work great, and I love that they now give you the option to tap to turn the page rather than having to swipe like you did with the last version of the nook.The full web is pretty easy to use once you get used to typing on a touch screen keyboard (which is always annoying).This device also integrates with your facebook, twitter, and google accounts.  This is great for the avid readers that want to be plugged into their social media.Another feature that is nice to have on the reader is Pandora- it is a nice added bonus to have internet radio available on the reader.One thing I wish this device had was access to android market, but I guess you can't have everything.OVERALLI like this tablet.  I think it was a good buy and I would buy another one if this one broke.  For the price, you are getting an underpowered tablet, but it still has access to the full internet- which you can use multiple windows in.  It is primarily a reader, which makes me wish it were as easy on the eyes as e-ink, but for the market it is being geared towards, you can't really complain about that!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent value for what it is- a reader with an LCD", "unixReviewTime": 1298246400, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2011"}

The prices of straight tablets were outrageous to me when my primary purpose was to eliminate taking the laptop along to be able to review email and do moderate web browsing on a decent sized screen (the phone was way too small).  After reading several reviews and recommendations, I settled on a used Nook Color for both price and performance.  I have not been disappointed.  I have rooted my device for a full blown Android experience and a far superior web browser but rooting is not needed for the basics. I'm just someone who likes to tinker.Everyone needs to understand, this is an e-reader first and a tablet second even when rooted.  At $200, you cannot expect what you would get with a $500-$600 device.  But, it does what it is intended to do quite well.  At 7 inches the screen is comparable size to most e-readers and that was important to me for portability.  I simply swapped the e-ink reader for the Nook Color and it still fit perfectly in my purse.  The Nook Color is also really good for reviewing emails and smooth web browsing.  My rooted device has an overclocked processor so I have no problems with speed.  It's perfect for quickly reaching out to the web to check the latest news, weather, etc. and then get right back to reading my books.  I haven't had many problems running other Android tablet applications and have found that the problems I have had seem to be common problems with the applications themselves.If you want a premium e-reader, this is a super nice product at a great price.  If you're looking for a budget tablet without all of the bells and whistles (camera, gps, microphone) but that will handle the basics of email, web browsing, Netflix, Hulu Plus, and other consumption tasks, this is more than adequate and enjoys much more favorable reviews than similarly priced tablets (with the exceptions of the Kindle Fire and its own successor the Nook Tablet).  The bottom line with this little marvel is to keep your expectations in line with what you're paying for and what you're not paying for.

Then one day it stopped working so he called customer service and was transferred to some foreign country where the woman could not speak English well,  so he asked to speak to another. Next a man came on who spoke worse that the woman so he asked if there was another person. When talking to the next person he was rude so he  asked customer service if he  could sent it in for repair.  The Nook Rep.  had gotten mad and said sure sent it back to North Korea and hung up the phone.  He said he  sent a number of Emails and they didn't  respond or when they did they say read the manual.  So John the Nook is great until you need service but to answer your question I can't open mine  to see the format so you may have to go by a Barnes and Nobel and ask them.

After researching the popular e-readers i.e. the Kindle Fire, I went with the Nook Color for one simple reason; the ability to Root it and turn it into an Android tablet, for a lot less! (It also takes a macroSD card). While you can find the Kindle rooted too, I found the Nook Color rooted was more readily available and more affordable. Since I was purchasing for a teen I  did not want to get a new or more expensive model.We purchased one that was already rooted to cyanogenmod 7.  You can also purchase an macro SD card here or on Ebay that is rooted for you if you already own a Nook Color.We connected it to our home wi-fi and Viola, she can do everything i.e. text free, download games and unlimited apps from the Market. The rooted Nook Color can do everything a tablet can do except for make or receive phone/video calls.Note, all rooted Nook Colors are not the same version.  We purchased one for our son for this Christmas and I did not notice it was not cyanogenmod 7.  This is relevant as it did not possess full access to all of the apps on the Google Play (or Android market) as our daughter's does.  You can update the Root software and I did that but I did not notice a change in its ability to download the other apps. But honestly, I was tired at that point and gave it to our son on Christmas as it was good otherwise and I doubt he would notice. LolThis model is perfect for my teens, but I am thinking about the Kindle Fire HD for myself because it has a good camera and I love photography.P.S.

I actually bought the Nook Color (NC) more for its tablet features than its e-book features.  I considered several tablets for at least double the price, but when the new Android OS was released for the NC, I decided to try it out.  I personally have not been disappointed.Here is what it doesn't have: camera, USB accessory support, fast processor, robust app forum, 3G model, and long battery life.  But as I said I am willing to pay less for less.  I primarily wanted it for basic web browsing (with Flash capability), movie playback, e-mail capability, and e-book capability.My experience has been great so far - I have had my NC for about six weeks.  I personally have had no problem with the web browser and it has met all of my needs.  Movie viewing has been fine and I have had no problems viewing them.  I use Handbrake to convert movies/videos to a format for the NC, and it works great.  I have several e-mail accounts I use for personal and business purposes, and the POP3 support the NC offers is perfect.  I am no longer tied to my PC, laptop, or confined to the small screen of a mobile phone.  As for the e-book reader, it's great as should be expected (My 8 year old daughter actually uses it for reading more than me.  I download books from the library for her, and she loves it.)  The notation, highlighting, and other reading tools are fine and it also has several options to customize the font and background color as well as the font size.Other reviewers have commented about crashes, but I have not had a single crash yet.  And I also don't think the stock Android OS is bad at all, but with this being my first experience with a tablet and Android OS, my expectations may have been lower than normal.

Gondhalekar", "helpful": [12, 12], "reviewText": "I was instantly the hero for my wife this Christmas, when I surprised her with a nook color under the tree. The device has great aesthetics, with a 7 inch IPS LCD display that is one of the most pleasing I've ever laid my eyes on, a thin and sleek profile, wonderful packaging, and nice support from Barnes and Noble, but that as Paul Harvey would say is only the beginning, this review is about the rest of the story.  At first glance this appears like just another eReader, but with a color screen for magazines and children's books swapped in for the normal eInk, but there is something different lurking beneath.  This device runs android 2.1 under the hood, heavily modified as it may be out of the box, and with that choice of operating system comes a potential access a world of hackery that is well beyond the reach of any other eReader.  In order to access this world you need to be willing to educate yourself a bit and root this device.  The process is actually quite simple (go to XDA-Developers forums or nookdevs.com Nook Color portal to read about it), and despite the dire warning disclaimers quite foolproof, and fully reversible (just in case you need warranty service).Once rooted, the device gains access to android market, where you can get thousands of apps, games, and tools for free (legally), or for a small purchase price.  Compared to the currently empty nook app store, the android market is bursting with exciting activity.  A rooted nook color gets access to the kindle app, so you can basically read all your amazon purchases on this device too.  Sony Reader app is coming soon from what I've heard, so you are probably going to get support for that store too.  Tied to the Kobo ecosystem, to borrow a phrase, there is an app for that.  Emulators for old game consoles are working nicely.  Playing Angry Birds on a 7 inch tablet is so much more fun than on a tiny 4 inch phone.  Stock browser lacks pinch to zoom, download Dolphin HD, and there you go.  Can't put app shortcuts and widgets on the home screen, home switcher and one of the freeware launchers (ADW is pretty nice) got your back.  A rooted nook color becomes something of a worthy competitor to the much more expensive iPad and Galaxy Tab.  Unlike real android phones and tablets, this does lack the physical menu, back, and search buttons, but a software softkey is installed upon rooting, so there are functional on-screen virtual equivalents to do the job.Don't get me wrong, there are some things that won't work, as nook color lacks a 3G radio, camera, or GPS.  The ROM is also a heavily modified version, so some abilities have been stripped out, and won't be available until a true custom ROM is available.  But more apps a likely to work than not due to a capable processor, ample storage packed underneath, and most importantly a talented and dedicated hacking community willing to experiment with their device and then educate others.  This is still early in the development life cycle of the nook color, so their are some rough edges to the process, some things will require resorting to the command line to fix.  Considering what you get for the money, this is probably the best handheld portable device on the market today.

The software is buggy, ironically one of the buggiest parts is trying to buy a book, where it more often than not hangs after a purchase with the download in limbo.  The battery charge socket seems to be flakey, so that often the unit gets confused about whether it is charging or now.2) Can't buy books when you're outside the US.  So, on an international business trip - when it'd be nice to pick up a few books for the plane or to pass time in a cafe - one can't buy a book.  That sucks.3) Although in theory I could load a bunch of PDF documents onto it for reading, the display is too small for them.  The interface for PDF documents, in terms of adjusting fonts, scrolling, is very limited.  Device is useless for this.4) The book selection is slim.  I don't think my tastes are that obscure, but I'm not interested in the mass market.  Forget pulling out old sci fi classics.  Forget getting a textbook.  And I find that some of the books that I would like to read are available for the Kindle but not the Nook.5) The iPhone Nook app is super buggy.

This is all despite having an international credit card accepted all over the United States (even by Barnes & Noble themselves as this is the same card that I used to pay for my B&N; membership) and despite even giving them my US postal and physical address where all of my packages would be signed for  by a real person.The thing that angers me the most is that I explained to Barnes & Noble (via phone) that I live in Trinidad and they said that it would not be a problem for me to purchase books, but after purchasing a Nook color plus additional items such as screen protectors, a leather case and a 32 gig Sandisk memory card (all bought on Amazon), I have not been able to purchase a single book.If International Customers are not welcome, there should at least be some type of warning on their website. I feel like I was ripped-off by Barnes & Noble, and the sad thing about it is that I bought it all as a birthday gift for my wife. Shame on Barnes & Noble, that sales rep lied to me just to make a sale, my money was good enough for them but I am not good enough for their product. Now I have this New Nook color with all of these extras just gathering dust.It is sad to see just how low some companies will stoop to make a dollar.The real slap in the face is that after registering the nook on the Barnes & Noble website for the purpose of purchasing books, they have no problem sending me offers week after week to purchase even more of their products but as far as I am concerned, they have lost this customer permanently.P.S. This review has nothing whatsoever to do with Amazon.com, my gripe is with Barnes & Noble for giving false information to secure a sale and caring nothing about International Customers.(UPDATE  UPDATE  UPDATE)In the interest of fairness to Barnes & Noble and giving you Amazon.com community 100% reliable information I decided to open an account with a bank that's based in the USA to see if B&N; would be able to access the funds from that account, I'm trying to find out whether it's a location issue or just a payment issue so we can all know for sure.I decided to try this little experiment because I just can't understand how I can gain access to sample books from B&N; but every time I try to purchase one there seems to be a problem, what makes this whole thing even more confusing is the e-mail that was sent by B&N; after I tried to purchase a Book via my Scotia Master Card (books can only be sold to customers \"physically\" residing in the United States).I now have a Bank Of America Visa Debit Card which I have not tried as yet, it is possible that the issue with Barnes & Noble is that they cannot access funds from my Scotia Master Card which is based in Trinidad so I will give the Bank Of America card a try seeing that it's based in the USA and if that does not work then the last resort will be to try using my Pay Pal account. I'll post an update as to whether it worked or not.(UPDATE  UPDATE  UPDATE)I'm sorry for taking so long but anyway, let us get on with it.  As I said before, every time I tried to purchase a book there seems to be a problem, what makes this whole thing even more confusing is the e-mail that was sent by B&N; after I tried to purchase a Book via my Scotia Master Card (books can only be sold to customers \"physically\" residing in the United States).Well I found out that IT IS POSSIBLE to purchase books on the Nook once you are using a US based card. I was not able to purchase books using my Scotia Master Card but I had no problem whatsoever when using my Bank of America Visa Card, so it definitely has nothing to do with our geographical location, or IP address. The only issue that I see here is the fact that not everyone has access to a US Bank Card but you may still have a chance with making purchases via PayPal.I have noticed that there are some US based sellers that have problems accessing funds from Trinidad based Credit Cards, some even have problems accessing funds from US based Cards although they are also in the US themselves, in cases like this I've found that the best payment method to avoid any headaches is via PayPal. I've never had any issue when paying via PayPal, even when other forms of payment could not work.I hope that this helps a little.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS BEWARE", "unixReviewTime": 1332374400, "reviewTime": "03 22, 2012"}

Our county library lends out e readers for patrons to try so I got on the list and after three months it was my turn to try the Kindle Color Nook. It doesn't overwhelmingly impress me though the color and clarity of the screen is as good as Our Kindle Fire's. Text on the screen is clear and turning the pages is easy. ONE advantage the Nook has over the Fire is that it shows page numbers instead of the Fire's percent of book read. Mrs. Spudman would prefer to have page numbers but has adapted to the percents.My wife and I are both comfortable navigating the Fire and barely had to refer to the owner's e manual. I don't like moving around on the Nook, and that may be solely because I'd become used to the ease of the Fire. Trying to surf the web on the Nook was very frustrating, and watching movies or video clips on the Nook was an ordeal with herky jerky motion, slow responses, and freezes. We watch free TV shows on the Kindle Fire with smooth enjoyment.The Fire was a gift to my wife from me. She loves it. If I were to buy a small device for reading, I'd prefer to  buy a tablet and download a reading program on it that enables book downloads. That method may preclude the ability to get free books (it does on the Kindle), but it's a circumstance I'd accept.In summary, the Color Nook is pretty good as a reader. Those with children might be intrigued by the animation capacity of the Nook on some children's books and the option to have the book read aloud by the Nook voice. As a web browser, the Nook , in my experience, doesn't work as well as the Fire does.In choosing between the two devices, I chose the Fire because I prefer the Amazon site to B&N;'s, like the vast number of Kindle books on Amazon, and was totally persuaded by the vast array of  free books, movies, and TV shows that come with Amazon prime.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A Little Nook e", "unixReviewTime": 1332028800, "reviewTime": "03 18, 2012"}

Once that happens, you have access to the android market, email, web browser, and more importantly, you can get apps that are better than the default nook book reader. You can even put amazon's android kindle reader on it as well.The reason for the relatively low rating is that all of these features and functionality should have been unlocked by default. The default software that comes with it feels unfinished and lacking in features to me, and it seems like B&N; were just being lazy when putting it together. Rooting it is also a pain, and even though there are some rough edges in a fully unlocked android OS on an eink interface, I still think that it is better than the default software.

I LOVE THE DISPLAY.  That's it.  A real home run?  Not quite...Quick summary is that they won't sell me any other unit with an LCD (I spend all day looking at one of those, I don't want another one for my fun-reading).  I might as well use my netbook or go all the way to a real tablet, and that won't be from B+N.Here are the problems with the whole Nook thing.(1) You can't use it for a PDF, magazine, or anything with graphics because YOU CANNOT ZOOM OR ROTATE. I have purchased some books with pictures and figures that you can't see.  Guess they want you to get the color tablet-like Nook, huh?  Nope, not going there (see above).(2) YOU CANNOT SHARE BOOKS. Yeah, yeah, they SAY you can, but that's VERY LIMITED and makes no sense.  (If the publishers trust them enough with their DRM to have the book at all, why can't you transfer the book to someone else using the same DRM?) I can get a paperback, read it, and share it forever.  Not so with Nook and you know it.(3) B+N (and everybody's) E-BOOKS COST THE SAME AS A NEW PAPERBACK, even though the seller didn't incur any cost of printing, shipping, inventory, etc.  But I can get a paperback for 25% off at my local Kroger grocery store for new releases and best sellers, or I can go down to the used book stores and find quite a few titles at 50% (or more) off list.  When everybody in my family has read that book, I can sell it to the used book store for 15% or 25% of list value.  That's a win-win.So, where's the advantage with a Nook other than it's cool?

While there were things about the Kindle I really liked (features that other reviewers on the Kindle site had written), the one thing that made me choose the Nook was the ability to borrow and read ebooks from my local library. Haven't been back to the library since!Now here comes the Nook Simple Touch Reader (Nook STR). I got one via pre-order when they came out in early June.  It has the same e-ink Pearl screen as the Kindle, so the screen contrast is no longer an issue. And wow, has the user interface improved over the original Nook! (which I thought was clunky) The entire e-ink Pearl screen has full touchscreen capability. On both the Kindle and the original Nook, I felt myself wanting to touch the screen to select a book to read, instead of using the buttons (on the Kindle) or the LCD touchscreen (on the original Nook) to highlight and select the desired ebook. On the Nook STR, the Library screen shows icons for all the ebooks loaded in the device (both library and purchased). Touch the icon, and the ebook opens. Turning the page? Touch the screen on the right side of the page (to go forward) or the left side (to go back). Or swipe your finger across the screen as in flipping a physical book page. Or use the buttons built into the frame. Want to page quickly through a book? Hold down the page turning button. Need a word definition? Touch and hold on the word and a dictionary pops up. The user interface resembles that of an iPhone or iPad, with the icons, virtual keyboard and the physical home button. It even has the \"slide to unlock\" feature like the iPhone. The touchscreen on the Nook STR is infrared (it senses the heat of your finger, again like iPhone), so a light touch works just fine. I found that on the original Nook, sometimes it would take multiple touches on the LCD screen for the device to recognize a command.In response to the reviews about the touchscreen ceasing to respond, the pre-order Nook STR I had suffered from that problem.  The touchscreen would become slow to respond, and eventually quit working altogether.  A power cycle generally brought it back.  I started a thread on B&N;'s website about this and found many others having the problem.  I did take my Nook STR back to B&N; and they exchanged it.  Have had the replacement Nook ST for six weeks now and the problem hasn't returned.  So don't be spooked about buying one due to this problem - if it happens to you, exchange it.Going back to library books, I had to install Adobe Digital Editions onto my PC (my library had the link to download - free).  This software allows you to manage your ebooks on your Nook.The Nook STR is a good choice for seniors that may not have extensive computer skills.  Using the device is easy enough, but loading books from a library website (via Adobe Digital Editions) requires a few steps to complete.  If help is needed, it can be a positive relationship-building experience.One last plus - once you get your Nook STR, check the \"Shop\" tab to access B&Ns; website.

If you are looking for an all purpose ePad or IPAD alternative, buy another product!  That's clearly not what Barnes and Noble designed this unit for.

It is incredibly light weight - much lighter than even a typical paperback.  It is easy on the eyes for extended reading periods and can be read in basically every lighting situation you could read a real book.  The clarity is sharp but not overpowering on the eyes like an LCD type display is after a few hours.The battery life is insane.  If you turn off WIFI, which should be normal unless you are looking for another book, the battery doesn't need recharging for weeks on end.  Page turning is a simple touch to the left or right of the screen.  Assignable buttons are also provided for pagination but they require a rather firm press.

You will need a Nook Color or an ePad like Xoom or IPAD for that.  But the downside with those is that the LCD type display cannot be read in direct sunlight so good luck at the beach or pool.One nice feature I use now and then is the dictionary.

This device fills a niche- if you want to annotate pdf documents or watch movies or any of those other things, get a tablet or the iPad or the kindle fire. This device is designed to read books, and it does a beautiful job at it. I purchased my Sony reader expecting to be able to add comments in it, but it was way too difficult, and ultimately I decided to purchase an iPad. Like the Sony reader, the nook can take notes but wouldn't be a great device to purchase for that purpose.It was pretty easy to set up- I didn't read the instruction manual, but I usually don't. I just followed the on screen instructions to connect it with my internet, my barnes and noble account, and then plugged it into my computer to sync it with library books. I had a bit of trouble connecting it with my internet, but that has happened with every new device I've purchased, so I think its my internet's fault, not the nook. I went through the steps a few times and then it started worked.I really like holding it to read- I generally read ridiculously thick books, so its nice to have something small and light to hold instead of a massive book that I have to prop up (and its so much nicer to read from than an iPad- the iPad is fine to read from, and i never seemed to feel screen fatigue, but it is way too heavy to hold with one hand). Initially I didn't realize that the two buttons on either side of the screen move the page forward or back, so I was touching the screen each time- the delay time is a bit longer that way, and it was annoying to have to use both hands. As soon as I realized that the buttons existed, the experience got even better.The battery life seems great- I charged it all the way up using my usb-to-outlet power adapter that I have for my iphone/ipad, and it worked great. I haven't had to charge it again, and I've been reading for about an hour each day.The one thing that surprised me and was frustrating for a few minutes was when I realized that I couldn't load my other epub books onto the nook because there wasn't enough room. The advertised size of the nook is 2gb, which is a ton of books, but it wasn't enough room for the books I've acquired through other sources- like google book downloads. A quick google search solved this problem- barnes and noble appropriates the majority of this space for content you purchase directly from barnes and noble. Fortunately there is an easy solution- there is a slot for a microSD card, and I happened to have a 2gb one lying around- plus they only cost about $5, if that. I popped it in, turned the device off and on, and I was ready to go again. Not a deal-killer by any means, but something to consider if you're planning to add your own epub library to your nook.Kindle vs. Nook- I haven't owned a kindle, only used it for a few minutes, but my personal opinion as I decided which to purchase was this: price was important (and I got a great black friday deal on the nook), and since they were about the same price I wanted to support the more open epub format, since you can load books from other sources. Yes, its possible to convert epub to kindle format but its an extra step that many people won't be interested in.

Yes, the nook is quicker on the page turning and lighter but I am having too much trouble to appreciate faster and lighter.  I am having an infinite amount of trouble getting library books onto the nook - I've yet to succeed and the problems lie with adobe digital editions.  Why aren't nooks plug and play?  That's my first big problem.  I have no problem with my Sony and the library book I wanted is now on my Sony.  The second is that I like to read while I'm eating my lunch - ereader in left hand and fork in right.  It is not easy to change the page on the nook while eating - the bottom right corner is too far from my thumb and the bottom buttons are too high up the side.  The Sony has a set of buttons right in the bottom center, which is perfect placement.  I read the great reviews on the nook and for the price, I thought it was worth a try.  I'm also disappointed with the wifi registration requirement and wifi in general.  I don't need wifi on my ereader but it looks like they're all offering it now.  I also don't appreciate my registration info being used by B&N; as permission to start emailing me crap - I am already unsubscribed from that 'service'.  I'm definitely not happy with the nook and I'm going to save up my money to buy another Sony.**UPDATE 5/25/13**  I finally was able to download library books onto my nook but it was frustrating and time consuming; I finally found help online.  I have yet to discover a way to comfortably hold this book in my left hand and turn the page.  This was a very bad buy for me.  I bought a book-style cover for it and that was a waste of money as well as I find the cover just gets in the way.

The Franklin eBookman had nice hardware but dreadful firmware with more bugs than you would find in a swamp in summer.  The Ectaco Jetbook Lite had a number of glitches in its firmware as well, plus an extremely user-unfriendly upgrade method.I did encounter one major problem with this Nook Simple Touch -- the life of a battery charge was nowhere near the several weeks promised (with wifi off).  Fortunately, however, I called B&N; Customer Service, and they advised me to install the latest firmware, V1.0.1, which addresses the power issue.The upgrade proceeded easily and without glitches, and it seems to have solved the problem; though I haven't put the duration of a battery charge to the full test yet, the charge indicator is holding at 100% after a full day, including more than an hour of reading.  That compares very favorably to the 83% discharge rate I had been experiencing in just three days using the old firmware.  I will report back if the battery problem returns.Otherwise I prefer the Nook Simple Touch's ergonomics to the comparable Kindle.  The Nook's front is all screen, with no unnecessary keyboard keys.  Virtual keyboard keys appear onscreen when you need to search for something.  The unit fits nicely in the back pocket of my jeans or shorts, and it's trim and lightweight.There are convenient page turning buttons flanking the screen, making for easy one-handed operation in a subway.  You have a choice of font styles and sizes, and the screen is easy to read even under bright sunlight.  You can touch any word onscreen to get a quick dictionary definition (provided, I found, that the word isn't hyphenated and run on two lines).I like the ease with which you can download titles from the public library (you download to Adobe Digital Reader, which your library provides free, and then transfer the Epub books to your Nook with the USB cable provided).  The program recognized my Nook without any glitches.I also like being able to read any book for an hour a day FREE at the nearby B&N; store.Newbies should note that, in their apparent effort to keep the NST instructions short and simple, B&N; left out a few useful ones.  Notably: to close one book (so you can open another), press the Nook button below the screen (the thing that looks like an upside-down U) and enter \"library.\"  To lock the Nook immediately, without waiting for it to enter sleep mode, press the power button on the back briefly.  And to tell when the Nook has finished charging, wait for the little LED next to the USB input on the unit to turn from amber to green.So if you have been looking for an ebook reader offering great value and ergonomics, take a look at this Nook.  But make sure to upgrade to firmware V1.0.1 or higher!)UPDATE: Trust me to find the bugs in an ebook reader -- or perhaps they find me.  At any rate, I bought a copy of the American Heart Association Cookbook (7th Edition) and was dismayed to see some of the fractions describing quantities in recipes replaced by question marks!I emailed B&N; Customer Support, and they suggested that I try downloading the title again (which you do by archiving and unarchiving a title, whatever that means).  That didn't work, but I found that if I clicked the check box on the font selection screen marked \"Publisher's Default\" (or words to that effect), that seemed to solve the problem.  So if you're seeing question marks in any titles where numbers should be, try that solution!I sure love beta testing new products for these big companies -- NOT!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Right Touch", "unixReviewTime": 1314489600, "reviewTime": "08 28, 2011"}

I have an iPad but when I do read, sometimes staring at that screen for more than an hour can give me a headache.  It came down to this, the basic Kindle, and the new Kindle Paperwhite.  When I really thought about it, the Paperwhite was more than I really wanted to spend on something I would only use an hour or 2 a week.  I ultimately decided to get this because it could read epub files natively and didn't have to be converted to MOBI files which the Kindle uses.It wasn't quite as straight forward as I was expecting.  I initially thought it'd be like the iPad where you just drag the book into the Books section of iTunes and you're ready to go.  I dragged the books onto the Nook when it appeared on my desktop and nothing happened.  I found out you had to download ADE and set it up that way.  From there you have to add the books to ADE then add them to your Nook, not a huge deal, but a few extra steps compared to the iPad.I also noticed that scrolling between pages had a bit of delay compared to the iPad and that when you were trying to use the scroll bar to advance more than a few pages at a time, it wasn't the most accurate.  It also appears that page sync only works with content you purchase from them and not files you have already on your computer(I think the Kindle is the same way as well though).The reading experience is great though.  Its not too bright and easy on the eyes.  The Nook itself is pretty light so its not a hassle to hold it for awhile.  Library is also easy to scroll through once its on your device.Overall I am happy with it.  I mentioned its shortcomings, but they don't outweigh how easy it is to read and the overall reading experience.  From a reading standpoint I'd give it 5 stars, just some other things that popped up that aren't big deals, but noticable.  I'd recommend this to anyone like myself who doesn't do a ton of reading, but still wants a simple e-reader.

Just copy the documents to it and open to read them.I will NEVER buy these kinds of eBook readers anymore, not even the new Kindle as I heard they will show ads on the screen and the Kindle Fire will just immediately buy stuff from Amazon if I accidently click on some place, IT DOES NOT even show a confirmation screen (too greedy to make money) !!! I don't buy something to read these ads. Amazon and B & N are too greedy trying to push stuff on the users as they feel like, at the users expense.I will try to get a new Android tablet instead (for reading, and Internet browsing).

If you were to buy this Nook for your young son or daughter, they would be able to purchase anything at the flick of a finger, and it would charge to your credit card 'for your convenience'.  Similarly, if anyone found your child's Nook, they too could purchase anything using your credit card information.I tried get creative and purchased a gift card for my child but although this can create a credit on the child's account, B&N; still requires a credit card to be on-file in order to 'unlock' the book.

The Nook system, by comparison, is slow, clunky, and a massive security risk.If you setup the Nook and do not provide this credit card during setup, no books can be sent to the Nook wirelessly, they must be sync'ed with a cable tethered to a computer.  Since my 12 year-old daughter purchased this herself with her own money, I have no choice but to either tell her to eat the unit or use my credit card without any parental control.  Furthermore, it would appear that B&N; is entering into a contract with my minor daughter in this regard.  By opting out of this model, you are left with an utterly useless device.Why none of the other reviewers elaborate on this is beyond me.  I suppose if the device is owned by an adult this model would work, however if you are contemplating this as a gift for your child, I'd avoid any device related to B&N; altogether.I give them 2 starts for the hardware only but otherwise the device, in this case, is useless.  While you can delete your credit card from B&N;, the process is well hidden and you would need to add a card, order, download, sync, unlock, and then delete the card in order to get each purchase on the device.  Either that or hand your child your Visa and tell them to enjoy!

Contrast on the display was a big problem for me, and I wasn't especially keen that the Kindle uses a proprietary book format that cannot be read on other e-readers. So, as long as I stuck buying books from Amazon for a Kindle, I was fine; the second I ever wanted to move to another device, I couldn't take my books. This didn't sit well with me.When Barnes and Noble dropped the price of the Nook Simple Touch to $99 I decided to take the plunge. (Note that as of this writing, Amazon still has not reflected the price drop.) The newer generation screen, while still not perfect, is far, far superior than earlier generations. Reading indoors no longer requires a spotlight on the e-reader to maintain legibility. Anyone who owns an iPad or other tablet knows how intuitive a touch interface can be, so I'm delighted to say that the navigation issues previously posed by the joystick on the older Kindle are resolved with the Nook's new touch interface.Amazon released their own Touch e-reader just recently. While it now brings the Kindle in line with the capabilities of the Nook, it still lags in one area: proprietary book format. The Nook and all other major e-readers use EPUB, a now-standard file format for e-books. Amazon for its own reasons chooses not to. What this means in practical terms is that you pretty much have to buy all of your books from Amazon - and forget about taking them with you if you ever decide another e-reader is the better platform for you.I refuse to be a party to that kind of lock-in, which is why I am very happy with my Nook Simple Touch.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Very Pleasant Surprise", "unixReviewTime": 1321401600, "reviewTime": "11 16, 2011"}

Oh well.The Nook Simple Touch is a great e-reader. If you are looking for a tablet like device to surf the internet and check email, this is not the product for you. The e-ink screen is amazing. It looks like you are reading a physical book. I like that you can turn the page by pressing the buttons or touching the side of the screen. Either way will be useful depending on how you are holding the book. This is very simple, which I love. One night, I was lying down in bed and went to lay the Nook on it's side then immediately jerked it back up before the page orientation changed. Then I remembered that it won't do that; which makes this great for reading no matter what position you may be sitting or lying in.The Nook accepts epub books; which means that you can get books from a variety of stores, not just Barnes & Noble. I found that between the B&N; store and Google Books, you can get all of the classics for free. No reason to pay for one of those ever again. Download Adobe Digital Editions to put books on from other places; including borrowed books from the public library.The Nook doesn't handle pdf's well on its own, but there is a work around. Download Calibre, bring your pdf's into it and then convert them into epubs. Once you do that, you will be able to highlight and take notes like you can with the actual books.If you want a simple e-reader, the Nook Simple Touch is the best.

In the past month alone, I have made at least 12 purchases.  I was browsing around just now and decided to see what Amazon.com customers thought of my newest electronic device.  I was thrilled to see the high rating, but disappointed to see the price; $40.00 more than the thing costs at B/N since its release last month.  Amazon, you need to do better here!Now to the product - This is my first e-reader and I am certain that I went with the best product for me.  As someone who buys a lot of books from Amazon, I would have preferred to have bought the Kindle,especially since Amazon has more of the types of books I read and for much cheaper than B/N, but I just do not appreciate those tiny buttons on the device.  I absolutely LOVE my Nook Simple Touch, and I use it for several hours every day.  B/N has Free Fridays - when you can download a featured book for free -, book share -with contacts on your device and social networks, and free reading of selected books when you are in B/N.  My understanding is that I can go to local libraries and even borrow my books using my Nook; This may or may not be any special news.The touch screen is a bit sensitive on the device, so if you prefer not to use it, they are also tactile \"buttons\" that will allow you to change pages.  The home screen shows the book you are currently reading and the page number you are on - a few other books in your library, and some suggested readings.  You can create shelves that you name on which to house your books by categories. They do not look like physical shelves, rather they are just a grouping of books.Without going into more technical stuff that you can read online, I will say that if you are new to e-reading and you enjoy touch screens -  AND YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT THAT SIMPLY ALLOWS YOU TO READ - Do not hesitate to go into a B/N and try this out.  Some people buy this expecting it to browse the web (although it does have a hidden browser that the techies are working to hack) - Play their audio files, when there is not headphone jack (Techies have discovered that it DOES have built-in bluetooth, however), and folks buy this and complain that they do not like how it does not display their magazines in color.  It is not meant to do that - it is meant to be solely an enjoyable easy-to-use reading device that does not give you a whole lot of options to be distracted from the task at hand, READING!This is why I bought it - Eventually, I will get a nook color - or a Kindle *color* if they come out with one, but for now, I thoroughly  enjoy my Nook, which has encouraged me to slow down and spend so much more time in the peaceful, leisurely act of reading. In my excitement, I am reading like 8 different books at once.  That is the great joy of having an e-reader - speaking to those who are, just as I used to be, resistant to the e-reading craze - there is no more lugging around a bag filled with books, and when I get tired of reading one, another book is just a couple of swipes away. I am learning about how to get all sorts of books for free or low cost, as well as learning how to take advantage of conversion and e-book management tools such as Calibre.  I am having a blast with this thing!Yesterday, I received a nice leather case for it that I purchased off Ebay for a great price.  Once again, I looked to Amazon.com first, but there simply were not good options.

It now seems like fraudulent advertising because I've since read that the MSRP is $79.99Initially I had serious problems with the Nook, and requested a refund. The seller, BlueProton, refused to take returns or give a refund for it, and directed me to Barnes & Noble who referred me back to the seller, stating  that the seller should refund it within 14 days; at that time  I'd only had it a few days. My Amazon A to Z claim ended with Amazon siding with the seller, BlueProton because their policy stated that they would not accept returns on Nooks - something I did not see when I initially read their policy!Because neither BlueProton nor Barnes & Noble would take responsibility for the defective product, and their attitude was \"Take the money and run!\", I'm giving the Nook a low review although later I found an update for the Nook which resolved the problems - with no help or information from either seller or Barnes & Noble!I now enjoy using the Nook which is so much easier and more comfortable to hold than regular books while reading,  and to carry back & forth to work each day or to travel with. I don't like the gray screen which requires you to face the Nook towards the light; and I don't like the glare on the screen from the sun or lights. I have to sit \"just so\" to read it - which somewhat defeats the idea of portability. Overall I do like it, but it needs improvement.My favorite use of the Nook is to borrow my local library's digital books using the free Overdrive Media Console software which allows you to select & save your library (ies) and to directly access the digital library from it on your PC, and then sideload (drag & drop)the borrowed books to your Nook; no more time wasted or trips through rush hour traffic to browse, borrow or return books downtown, and no more parking hassles! Most of my library's digital books are in ePub format which is the native format of the Nook. However, as other reviewers have stated, you can still borrow or buy Kindle or other formats of digital books and convert them to ePub via the free Calibre software. Borrowed library books can be returned automatically when the loan periods expire, or can be returned manually earlier if you decide not to finish the book during the loan period.Ordinarily I don't buy many fiction books because I rarely read any of them more than once. Additionally, due to the poor customer service from both Amazon (who owns Kindle) and Barnes & Noble (who owns Nook) I am determined to rarely buy any books from either of these companies, and will primarily download either their free books or the library's loan books. The companies want us to buy their ebooks, but won't take responsibility for their e-readers, so that infuriates me and alienates me for life.The pros: the low price; comfort; convenience; savings from being able to borrow library books instead of buying something you'll only read once; no clutter of physical books; easy loaning to friends with a guarantee that they will be returned in 14 days (automatic returns); ability to read multiple formats via conversion in free Calibre software. The Nook can also read your PDF files/documents from your PC or elsewhere, plus it can use your JPEG files of photos to use as your custom screensavers; the Nook will convert them to B&W.;The cons: PlueProton's and Barnes & Nobles's total lack of responsibility for their defective Nooks - why I gave the Nook such a low rating; Amazon's siding with Blue Proton's irresponsible returns policy; dreary gray screen which makes it difficult to read except in bright lighting; touch screen not as sensitive and responsive as it should be - often have to touch the screen a few times before getting a response.Over all I'm pleased with my Nook Simple Touch now that I managed to FIX IT BY MYSELF, but the companies' irresponsible policies have soured me towards them for life.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "no responsibility from sellers for initially defective  new product", "unixReviewTime": 1361836800, "reviewTime": "02 26, 2013"}

I didn't realize that if you buy books from B&N;, you can only read them on your Nook, and not on anything else.  So even though you paid for them, those books really aren't your property.  You have no access to them if you don't use their products! Still, I liked the fact that it used ePub, and you had a variety of stores you could buy from and also that libraries have more ePub books available.  However, I just heard that their latest firmware update prevents you from reading any books except those bought from B&N.; If I had known this I never would have bought the Nook. It's as consumer un-friendly as you can get!  Really a nasty way to do business.  Amazon is different.  Once you buy a book, it is yours.  You can read it on any device. When it comes to buying books, Amazon is far easier to use and alot more consumer friendly.  The Kindle is by far a better choice of the two.I am returning the Nook after only a week, because this is a frustrating product that doesn't function like it is supposed to do.  There are simply too many glitches in how the touch screen works to be reliable. Here are the cons:  First, it often takes multiple touches to access anything.  You touch or swipe the screen, and nothing happens.  You try it again, and still nothing.  What a joke.  Second, pages turn mysteriously on their own and without warning, both forward and backward.  I am always losing my place when I try to read a book.  I've noticed that this happens almost every time you alter the angle of the Nook.  If you're reclining and turn to adjust the pillow, don't expect to return back to the same page you were on.  Third, the pop-up menu and dictionary are too easy to activate by accident.  If you hold the Nook too close to the screen, or at the top or bottom, the pop-up menu will appear or the dictionary will activate unintentionally.  This happens several times an hour.  You can't just simply sit down, relax and read unless you sit motionless in a chair and hold it on your lap. Last of all, it does not use a standard USB/micro USB cable. The USB connection to the computer is standard, but the micro USB connection to the Nook itself is NOT!  It is thinner and wider.  You can only use the cord provided with the Nook to connect to your computer to transfer files or charge the batteries.  You can't use the standard USB cord that works with all of your other electronic gadgets, like your digital camera or your portable hard drive.  So if you need a longer cord, or lose their cord, you're out of luck. Talk about a major inconvenience, one that makes zero sense!

I love the on screen virtual keyboard (like the ipad) and the fact that it's a lot smaller than the Kindle 3 but with the same size and quality screen.Since giving the Kindle to a relative I thought about the books that I already bought from Amazon and the fact that I now have to use my Android phone to read them since the Nook does not read Kindle books......or does it??With a little research I was able to find out how to root my Nook Touch (voids your warranty). Now when I turn on the Nook, it gives me a dual boot screen (sort of). I can go to the Android desktop or the the Nook screen. Using the Android desktop which included the Android market I downloaded the Kindle reading app. I ran that app, logged into my Kindle account and now have all my Kindle book available on my Nook Touch. The only thing missing is text to speech but I didn't use that feature anyway. Yes it has a web browser, email and all the other Android apps available but most look pretty drab on a monochrome device. That isn't why I did this. I wanted a device to read my Nook Books and Kindle books.I now have the best of both worlds.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic alternative to the Kindle", "unixReviewTime": 1315526400, "reviewTime": "09 9, 2011"}

Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service.  I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem.

Touch screen is about as responsive as my iphone 4s.  Includes cable that has a standard USB a jack that plugs into just about everything: the computer, my hub, and the standard variety of wall worts and car chargers.This device is hard directed for \"easy setup\".  Too hard.  There should be a way to accept the TOU and get to using the device.  Forcing wifi setup and registration is just bad planning.Wifi - This is the stupidest thing about this device.  Once you charge it up, you turn it on, it asks for you to agree to terms, then it goes through wifi setup.  Note, you must HAVE wifi, AND connect to it successfully for the setup process to continue.  At this time, I'm stuck.  I'm in a town with limited wifi options, so it's not like I can just select a local hotspot.  Until i register the device, I have a brick.I have an old Netgear Router 802.11g&b; with wep and wpa protection.  The nook is capable of wpa2 security, but managed the wep and wpa security pretty nicely.  Strange thing was that I could get past the password, but it still would not connect to the internet (I checked the setup with my iPhone and everything worked fine).  Customer service had very few answers and only about 3 steps for me to take to fix the problem.  I tiered up to the supervisor and managed to pry out of her that the Nook runs on an 802.1x EAP network.  Upon googling it, this looks like the same network that causes a lot of android problems.  Next step is to hunt down a public wifi and try again.However: As soon as the thing charged and turned on, it showed up on my desktop and I was able to upload screensavers, books, documents, etc.  The device has a VERY small available memory, (about 250Mb), so text only books can be loaded, but not large PDFs (I bought this to enjoy the Modernist Cuisine series, 300Mb+ PDFs).  I had an old version of Calibre that worked right away.I'll change this review and maybe the two stars rating once I have something more than an expensive SD card reader to play with.UPDATE (after a stop at Denny's)Okay, sure enough, Once in a local restaurant with free wifi, I was able to connect, register and start using my nook.  I made sure I had a couple books on it when I left, so I was able to read a chapter before I paid the check.In good light, this screen is beautiful.  The characters are crisp and clear, it's easy to read, and you can make several screen adjustments including a limited list of fonts, size and margins.  In lower light, the dark grey on light grey screen gets tougher to read than, say, a printed sheet of paper.  Still, in my apt with only a 60 watt light illuminating the room, it's still pretty easy to read.You get two choices on how the side buttons function.  Personally, I like the lower one turning the page forward; because I tend to hold it in the lower corner, cupped in my hand.  However, you can swipe the screen to turn pages, too.The OS on the nook is a little simpler than, say the kindle fire.  And maybe that's why I like it better.  On this device, books are books are books.  They can be epubs, pdfs, purchased or uploaded, they all go the same place, and they all end up in the same list.  Nothing grinds my gears more than having to look 2-3 places for things based on where you bought them, or some other phantom difference established by the designers (or worse, the marketing department - I'm looking at you Kindle).  The down side to this that if you have a large ebook library, you are pretty much stuck using the search function.  There doesn't seem to be a way to organize books any other way. [checking online....] Oh crap, they have this whole \"shelf\" system built in.  Damn, scratch that organizational thing, I'll get back to ya there.Screen Savers.Forget about those fancy things on your PC, the nook's idea of a screen saver is to place a picture on the screen when it sleeps.  The default is a bunch of pictures of famous authors.  nice, you can also choose nature scenes.  But, remember I said that you could upload directly to the nook?  Well, here ya go. Create a folder with the name of your screen saver set, upload some 800x600 pics (jpg/png formats) in portrait mode and Voila! You have your own custom set.  I went to nook.com and downloaded a bunch of Str Trek Geeky stuff at first, but then realized I could just take a few snapshots and convert them to 16 greys myself.  Now I have a folder of a dozen of MY pictures as the screen saver.  Very nice.  Kinda like having an image viewer as well.Calibre.Getting calibre to work with the device once it was working was a complete breeze.  I bought a 16gb micro SD on sale and added it.  The card mounts on the desktop separately, but calibre is all tuned up to read them correctly.  So, when you put stuff on the device, you have the option of loading it in main memory or on the card.  Come to think of it, a series of small cards could be another way to organize as well.  Put your SF collection on this card, classics on that one, etc.  Fun.Oh, also, once I got the registration completed at Denny's I went into settings and disconnected the wifi.  It's been operating in that mode ever since.  So, only that first time is needed.Adding two more stars for all the juicy goodness.  I'll play around with it a while and see if we can get it to 5.  No real serious problems yet.UpdatePDFs - Okay, so pretty much everything else that displays pdfs tries to incorporate the formatting of the document.  This strange little device actually reads the text (easiest way to save formatting = text + format), and produces it in standard format.  It's a little disorienting but it makes for a much more consistent reading experience.Micro SDI think my real problem with this device was getting a huge SD card for this then thinking I had to fill it with a whole library.  Bah!  Granted, those 6 really large PDFs need some room, but I could have fit them all on a 2 Gb card and still had plenty of room to spare.  *sigh*  All that room meant I could have 100s of books on the device.  Think: Tim Taylor \" More Power!\" {grunt grunt}Shelves.  The device keeps track of the shelves internally, so it's not like a document you could edit outside the device and use your computer's search function to organize.  you MUST go through your entire library, no search functions, one book at a time to add to shelves.  Great if you know what you're looking for, but not all sets start with Lord of the Rings 1: ....If you buy this, don't get an external card right away.  the onboard memory can hold a lot of stuff.  Shorter onboard lists mean you have less stress with shelves and such.I won't be exploring the B&N; store for a while (a Long while).  I have a massive library to work through first.  So look elsewhere for those reviews.  I've heard the store is mighty nice though.No ads, easy to use, a joy to read.  This, my final entry sees that last star moving up the device.  Take heed of the speedbumps I've experienced and enjoy this cute little reader.  Now, I just need a case.....  :)ANOTHER UPDATE: Months later and I've read a small library on this thing.  It's a delight.  but I still find myself avoiding PDFs a lot because of the disorientation.  Also: to the 2 people who did NOT find this review helpful - Bite me.

Boston", "helpful": [212, 215], "reviewText": "MORE UPDATES at the bottom of my review!My review includes details of Kindle 3, the newest version! With the time period, I could still return my nook, but I'm still completely in love with it and don't want the kindle for the reasons below.I was one of those people who was averse to the idea of an e-reader for a long time. I liked the feel of a real book, I was in love with free books at the library, why would I start paying for them? Then, my library got \"overdrive\", which is e-books FREE from the library. Then one day soon after, I woke up and the urge for an e-reader was there. The Nook was my final choice. It took a lot of back and forth and research to get to this point. I bought and tried the Sony Touch reader, returned it, and went and got the Nook. I really honestly wanted the Kindle most, because I'm a loyalist. I love Amazon and felt really comfortable here if I decided to actually start purchasing books again. But below, I'll give you comparisons to the three big readers and the reasons I got the nook:- Nook(N) by barnes & noble- Kindle 3(K) by amazon.com- Sony Reader Touch(ST)1. My biggest decision maker was Epub. This is the format in which you can take ebooks out of the library, so I needed whatever I got to be Epub friendly.N: The Nook is epub friendly. As well as PDF, and many other formats.K: The Kindle won't use Epub, which was all I needed to know. It mainly uses it's own Amazon format,while it also uses PDF, mobi and a few others. It makes me feel like Amazon is being greedy, wanting us to only use and buy books from the amazon site. Don't they understand that I love my library?ST: Sony reader is Epub friendly. pretty much the same as the nook.2. PRICE!N: 149 with wifiST: 169 NO WIFIK: 139 with wifi(or 189 with wifi and free 3G)While kindle 3 is 10 dollars cheaper, it doesn't give me those free library books, so it really doesn't make any difference to me.*You can now lend some books from the Nook for 14 days to a friend with their new \"lend me\" technology. While this is in beta stages, and not ALL books are lendable. It depends on the agreement with the publisher. The other two you cannot lend at all.*The Nook has a replaceable, rechargable battery. So it'll last awhile, but when its dwindling, you can spend 30 bucks and put a new one in yourself. For the Kindles, they are sealed inside. People have said you can do it yourself, but you must be tech savvy. Or you can send it away to Amazon for about the cost of [...]+shipping charges and they'll replace it for you.*You can expand your memory on the Nook and on the Sony touch. The Kindle you cannot, though the Kindle will hold 3,500 books, don't know if you need more space then that?!*Nook has a fancy color touch screen at the bottom. While the Sony touch has a touch screen(the entire screen), it was slow to respond, very klunky and not very pretty. The kindle is loaded with buttons along the outside of the screen.* all three have a built in dictionary, which I think is just awesome.*The new kindle now meets with the nook on their slim width. People used to say the nook was more comfortable to hold because of the width, now the kindle will be as well.*Yet, the Nook is heavier by about 3 oz then the Kindle or Sony.*The Nook battery life lasts about 10 days with wifi off, the Sony has 14 days, and the new kindle is up to a month with wifi off(3 weeks with it on)This wasn't a big deal to me, and I was more interested in the other features the Nook DID have, like replaceable battery and expandable memory.*And you may be wondering, why did I purchase a Sony Touch, and then scamper back hours later to return it? Well. When I got it out of the box, it wasn't techy enough for me. It felt like a very basic, bare bones E-reader. And I already had in my head all the things you hear about the nook: books more expensive, and for some reason I thought it wasn't epub friendly. But the moment I had that Sony in my hand, I went to look at the nook more indepth online. The Sony online library was nothing in comparison to Kindle's Amazon.com or Nook's Barnes & Noble. One of my favorite reads recently was The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. It was nowhere to be found on Sony. That gave me a bad taste in my mouth.*In the past people have complained that Barnes & Noble is significantly more expensive then Amazon. I did some price comparisons of big titles, and found them most of the time to be exactly the same. I think Barnes & Noble might be trying to keep in line with Amazon to draw more readers(Like ME!) into getting the Nook.On the whole, the nook is everything I wanted. I've downloaded some free classics from google books, I've taken out library ebooks and it was REALLY easy! I even bought my first book(well, ebook) in a long time. Despite being a new release, it was under ten bucks. I also bought another book I've been meaning to read for years for under four dollars. The nook is comfortable to hold with one hand. I like the using the touch screen to \"swipe\" and turn pages. And tops on my list, I didn't feel horrificly guilty for buying it. One fifty is a reasonable price for such a fun new book reader.Update Oct '10: A software update is coming in Nov:\"dramatically increase page turn speed, customized B&N; Library organization and password protection. It also includes the ability to sync across all NOOK and all devices enabled with our free NOOK apps, by syncing your last page read. If you forget your NOOK at home, use the NOOK app for iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, Android smartphone or PC to pick up where you left off. And, the next time you pick up your NOOK, the Reading Now page will be updated and ready to go.Update Dec '10: The update was a pinch to install, and it has some stellar perks that make the nook even more loveable. The shelving option it a lot of fun for those people who like to organize. You can name a shelf anything you want. The only limit is your Barnes and Noble book will stay in their Barnes folder, while any other books you have will stay in My Documents. The page turn is very fast. I do read across multiple devices, but for most people that will be a great new feature.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Comparison: Nook vs. Kindle 3 vs. Sony Touch from a library book lover", "unixReviewTime": 1279584000, "reviewTime": "07 20, 2010"}

Reinecke", "helpful": [25, 25], "reviewText": "UPDATE 6/3/10:  B&N; is offering a $50 gift card with every purchase from June 2 =>.  They will honor purchases up to two weeks prior to the launch of the promotion.  I bought mine 5/22 and my gift card arrives in 10 business days!  Now that's what I call a customer-focused company with excellent customer service.  Another and very important reason why nook beats Kindle.nook review:I did my research on e-readers and thought long and hard about the two main contenders - nook and Kindle.  I chose the nook.  Why?...1) It's design is future-proof (as far as anything is) because the hardware is designed such that software and firmware updates can make it more functional in the future.  Kindle requires new hardware. I just read a new one will be out in August '10, and no, no touch screen!2) Amazon (Kindle) is not a dedicated book store whose sole livelihood is books, like B&N; (nook).  Amazon has demonstrated this with its wrangling with publishers to the dismay of both the publishers and Amazon's customers3) Yes, the nook was rushed out last year but they are now already on V1.3 software, but it works well and has added features and corrected some early flaws.  The page turns are now quicker and very acceptable, especially compared with a real book page turn.  Whoever you are with, they will have some problems and features you do or don't like.  There are supposedly more books via B&N;, but never the books you actually want to read - Kindle has some missing for me as well as B&N.;B&N; will no doubt keep updating its software regularly and Amazon make you pay for new Kindles (and risk you not being able to read your e-books on the next version, like V1 to V2)E-book pricing is a little crazy right now as publishers seem to be trying to establish the \"value\" of e-books versus paperback/hardcover.  Some e-books are more expensive and some are changing prices weekly.  It's the same situation with both Kindle and nook from what I can tell.4) The touch screen is a nice feature (future-proofed hardware), but big fingers can hit the wrong selection occasionally.  It is comparable with the iTouch touchscreen performance IMHO.  Navigation is maybe more hassle than the Kindle as a result.  This also makes the nook smaller (no physical keyboard to worry about) and easier to hold, even though it is marginally heavier than the Kindle.5) The nook can be personalized with your own photos for wallpaper and screen-savers (wrong wording as it's just a picture for when the nook is in sleep mode - No burn-in with e-ink screens). You can add more storage in a nook with a micro SD card6) The Kindle battery lasts longer, but the nook is fine with the Wi-Fi turned off - about 10 hours.  The nook battery is user-replaceable and costs just $29, unlike the Kindle7) The nook extended warranty covers ANY accidental breakage/spillage for the full 2 years.8) A B&N; store is always nearby to get help in person and they currently offer a free book per week when you visit the store (in week 2 of 5 right now)9) Using independent free software available on the web (Calibre), I can convert and \"sideload\" documents and news feeds to my nook.  I have sideloaded web pages (originally saved as HTML), word documents and .pdf's, all in .epub format.  This is no doubt possible with Kindle too, but the nook is more than flexible for my needs.  I read USA Today and The BBC news feeds on my nook every day and they include B&W; photos and diagrams which are clearly readable.  Calibre has many more available.10) Using Sigil, again free software, I can modify e-books to add chapters or correct errors and sideload them to my nook.  Again, no doubt a possibility with Kindle, but I am not sure.11)  Nook is just the one size, no Kindle DX equivalent.  For my needs though, the small nook is \"back pocket\" sized (literally fitting in my back pocket) and is small enough to read but carry around.  I need reading glasses without exception to read and so can read at the smallest text size with no problem.12)  I'm not bothered about having a music player and the built-in speakers are not really capable as listening devices (tinny and low volume), but it's there and will no doubt allow for text-to-speech in a future software release, which will be useful.  The sound quality through headphones is good.I've had my nook a week and have read two books and many daily news articles.  It's comfortable to use, it's fun to use and while maybe a luxury we could all do without, I've read a couple free e-books that otherwise, I would never have done - and I have many more downloaded and ready in the wings.  It's actually now a hassle to read through a real paperback or hardcover.  :-)The choice is yours, but my choice was the nook and I think it was a good choice.UPDATE 6/2/10 - .PDF's on the nookI have found that .pdf books, especially with charts and diagrams (ie technical/text books) are problematic to read on the nook.  Interestingly the B&N; store personnel stated that they had never tried to read a .pdf on the nook - maybe just a way to avoid the issue??  However, the Kindle will no doubt have the same issue, unless you use the DX which is larger and so you can read .pdf's natively.If you read a native .pdf on the nook it is the whole page squeezed down to the 5\" screen - impossible to read.  If you use Calibre to convert the .pdf to .epub format, then the end result is variable.  Diagrams get screwed up or disappear and while text can be enlarged with the font size function, even the text formatting may or may not be acceptable.Either way, I have given up trying to read such books on my nook.  :-(I would not recommend the nook to anyone trying to use it for school where .pdf's are the only format available.  The problem is not nook/Kindle, but the way .pdf's are created.  They don't have the necessary information encoded to be able to convert them to other e-reader formats and retain their .pdf look.  If you are going to save any documents for conversion to .epub format, don't use .pdf.  I have found saving as .HTML renders a perfectly acceptable .epub file when converted, including diagrams and charts when archiving web pages, for example.See also my review of the JAVOedge Snake Skin Case for Barnes & Nobles Nook (Flip Style)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "nook review", "unixReviewTime": 1275177600, "reviewTime": "05 30, 2010"}

I remember when I used to scoff at the nook when walking into B&N; and can't believe I ever did that! I love the feel of being able to go into the bookstore, with my nook and feel connected to the actual store. I will admit you have to do your research (read forums, articles etc...) because the nook demo employees, are not going to know everything. Also you MUST read the 'manual' and follow it to a 'T' Don't take the reader out of the box and drain what little battery you have left because you're going to have battery issues (needing it to drain completely a few times and then fully charging it before the battery is at full capacity)A lot of people may think their nook is 'frozen' when actually the battery is drained, and when that happens the screen is set to whatever screen saver, book page etc you were on when it died. There's no 'power-down' it will just stop, and touchscreen will not be active, once you plug it up and charge it a little, it will be good again. Also the constant use of the touchscreen will drain the unit faster (obvious unfortunate fact)There are a lot of books available at the moment (depending what genre you read) especially for teen and sci-fi and fiction (my books), and I was surprised to see all of the 'lend me features' for a good portion of the books I was interested in. Also B&N; really listens to complaints and proves that with upgrades (faster page turning, less freezing etc.)Also even when there was a manufacturing error, they were quick to send out a new improved nook.

What appealled to me most were the web browser & ePub use to check out books from the library. However, after fully charging the nook, I took it with me for a weekend at the beach. I didn't bring the the charger because B&N; said battery would last up to 10 days with wireless off. Well, I found out the hard way, with wireless on, it barely a couple hours reading at night & in the afternoon by the beach. Oy, was I frustrated with nothing left to read & another night & afternoon left. Lesson learned: must bring charger everywhere! Lost 1 * for this.I'm not a fan of touch screens, still love my trusty push-button cellphone. So browsing the web was a pain for me, having to navigate around the screen with my finger. Page turning was fine, but I think I've overdone it since my finger began stinging from constant page-turning friction :0)). Scrolling down & up also frustrates me - most of the time I have to swipe several times to get it to move. Not to mention hitting the back button after book downloads - the response time was slow which made me think it didn't sense my touch, so I'd do it again & it goes back all the way to the main menu. Grrr! What a pain as I have to restart the store search & find the page again.B&N; samples are horrible! They give you 7 pages...but it's the cover, copyright, dedication page with only a paragraph of the actual story. Not enough to make me want to buy a book. The closest B&N; is 1 hour drive away so I couldn't take advantage of the cafe freebies or free reading in-store.After I discovered that I cannot organize books into folders, that was the final straw. I read novels with racy titles, my 10 y.o. son wanted to read his classics on the nook but I didn't want to lend it to him because he would see all my books & potentially read them.

Biggest waste of money I ever spent.  not worth the hassle of getting it repaired.  Made me miserable and unhappy for three days.  This is not how I want to spend my life--feeling miserable and abused and wondering how I got suckered into this huge mistake.The good--or perhaps the OK--I found nothing really good.GSM service is free for purchasing books and most uses. Not all that valuable.  I'd be happy with just WiFi and enough memory to carry around a personal library. with me.  GSM available for anything else but books.  Wifi works ok, after some fussing with the settings.  Many times I got error messages.  I kept trying until it worked.  There is some issue with the Wifi but it can be fussed with until it works--starting and stopping it.The bad--just about everything:I travel a lot, and need to carry my library with me.  This device does not work to download books outside of the US.  Why not?  I can understand the GSM not working, but if I have WiFi access somewhere, I should be able to load anything I want anywhere.  I can load books anywhere with my iPod Touch. Requires a US address.  Why?  Why can't anyone use it?  Device requires that you sign up with B&N; with a credit card.  Why can't I download free books without a B&N; account?  You cannot use this device until it is registered.This device is barely functional.  The interface is poorly designed, B&N; does a great job of making it difficult to find free books, and the books that are normally free--B&N; charges you $1 to $2 for these books! Outrageous!  Most people would not have a clue they are being ripped off being charged for books in the public domain.The interface is so bad that everyone is hacking these devices to make them functional.  Do a GOOGLE search for nook soft root--better yet check out YouTube and search for TROOK.Do a search on nook itself for free and you won't find free books, you will find books with \"free\" in the title or crippled editions with two chapters free.  There is no menu selection for find free books.  If you do find a free book it will be after wading through page after page of the same title--it would take days to find even a few interesting free books.  With the Kindle, at least you get to choose a few best sellers are part of your purchase price.  The B&N; give you nothing for free but garbage.  They want to frustrated enough to pay them more money for overpriced books.  Personally I can't see paying the same price for an electronic book as I do a paper bound book that I can resell or give as a gift.  Electronic books cost nothing to produce and distribute--why do they cost so much?  It is gouging, IMHO.To get a free book into your nook is a nightmare PITA.  I use an iPod Touch and was able to load 60 free books into it, in about 8 minutes--easy and simple.  Not menu after menu and then find out the book was not loaded after all.With B&N; nook it takes a long time to select and load a book.  You have to pay for a book, even if it is zero dollars--another menu choice, just to get you in the habit of hitting a purchase button.  There are lots of free books out there.  Why should it be hard to load these? Personally, I want a large library with me because I travel alot, and I want to find  what I want quickly, and I want to read it without hassle.PFD files can be loaded but these are not re-sized, so that type is pretty small and hard to read.  I can't read them, and I have reasonably good near vision.  If you are young with perfect vision you might be able to read for a while until your eyes get tired.  PDF don't work well on this device.Changing a page is a pain with the controls.  There is a way to use a finger swipe that some people have difficulty with.I personally hate wading through 40-60 pages on the life of the author, at the beginning of the book when all I want to do is read the book itself.  Books with a ton of crap in the front, with articles about the life of the author, acknowledgments, are a PITA toget around.  Scrolling down to chapter one to start the book is problematic--sometimes you are sent back to the index, other times you go to Chapter one. Why should I have to scroll and enter a command twice.  Why can't it work the first time?I constantly had the urge to use the white part of the device as a touch screen, but only the bottom is a touch screen.  I found myself thinking, my iPod Touch is better than this.  It is fast to touch what I want.  Give me something better like a Blackberry pointer ball!Display is flashing every time a page is changed.  I found this constantly annoying.  Why?  There is no reason for the flashing.  EVERY PAGE FLASHES AT YOU!  YOU WILL LEARN TO HATE IT!!!!USB power connector.  This is a weak spot of the device.  Instead of using a robust connector, they use a micro USB connector. It is wobbly. Even a mini-USB would have been better.  At times I  could not make this connector work.  It is delicate.  It doesn't want to mate up.  I found I needed to be very precise on aligning it, even then it would not connect.  I doubt that this will survive 100 re-connections.  If you buy this device, do not expect it to last more than two years.  It would be smart to get the extended warrantee--another $60 for two years--If you buy a nook.  Charge it only when you have too, or you will wear out this connector in a short period of time.  While the battery life is good, given the crappy connector, I don't understand why they didn't put a battery 2-3 times larger in this device so that the connector would last longer and have less wear.Memory Storage is limited to about 1GB with space to add another memory card.  To bring it up to 8 or 16 GB, it will cost you another $30 to $60, or if you buy it from B&N; it will be twice as much.  I feel the device is worthless without at least another 8GB of storage.  I'd rather it came with another 16GB.  The iPad comes with that much or more--so you get a color full touch screen for not much more than the cost of the memory you need.This is a good gift for someone clueless about electronics that won't know any better about how badly B&N; crippled their android operating system and don't understand what a good interface is all about.Do yourself a favor.  Try an iPod Touch, and I assume the iPad works as well.  Apple makes quality products that work right, with strong connectors, great software, and are backed up with the highest rated customer support.  B&N; built something with one purpose only, to sell electronic books--and to make it difficult to find free books, and to break quickly.  If you want to be screwwed over, buy one of these and then bend over because B&N; sees you as someone to be used and abused--not a valuable customer.If B&N; made it easy to download free books, I'd be more forgiving on the crappy software they use and the delicate power connector.  If B&N; made a decent, usable interface, and made it easy to load whole library's of free books, I'd probably buy some electronic books and they would earn my business.  As it is, I will never buy an e-Book or any other book from B&N.;  That is how angry I am about wasting money on this product.My nook is dead after only three days.  I wish I could return it.  I don't have the original packaging either, so that even if I got a new replacement, I cannot sell it on eBay to get my money back.  I'm not sure what I'll do.  I will be calling B&N; tomorrow to see about a replacement, and begging for a store credit instead so I can buy an iPad instead.The bottom line is, I'm more than disappointed about the product.  I'm angry enough that I'll never do business with B&N; again--even if they refund me the price of this device.  I don't even want it back if it were repaired.I'd rather pay $600 for an iPad, purchasing from a company that charges a lot for products that are well thought out and work well.  While I may wish the price was less for Apple products, at least I don't have this awful feeling of being screwwed ten different ways by B&N; with their service and nook product.For those who think this is a good product.

I think that both the Nook and Kindle are good products, but the Nook offers the user some unique advantages over its counterpart--the Kindle. First, a buyer can actually test drive the Nook before purchasing it at either Best Buy or at a Barnes and Noble store. The Kindle is only available on line at Amazon.com.  I cannot invest my hard earned money into buying an electronic device without trying it out first. The physical design of the Nook is attractive, sturdy, and compact. Navigating is easy. The user does not have to use the left/right arrows on the Nook to turn the page of an ebook.  The pages of a book can be easily turned by simply swiping the touch screen. Bookmarks can also be set. This is an important feature for me since I tend to read more than one book at a time. Secondly, the Nook offers web browsing.  I was able to link my Nook to my home wireless network and surf web pages.  Although the software is still in its beta stages, I am impressed at what I can already do.  Next, I can download and/or design wallpapers and screensavers for the Nook. This might be a minor point, but it makes the Nook unique and customizable for its owner. The Nook's storage capacity can be expanded. The Nook comes with 2GB of storage that the user can expand up to 16GB by purchasing and installing a micro SD card. The Nook's internal battery lasts about five years with normal use (this is according to technical reviewers), and a replacement battery can be purchased and installed by the user.

Glitz does not equal function, as I promptly found out.To be fair to Nook, if ALL you want to do is read, the device works, and works pleasantly.  I received my Nook in February, so it had the latest firmware updates, and I experienced none of the delays in downloading, missed sections of books, delays in page turning that early reports noted.  But if I was attempting to do anything more than clicking the page turning buttons, OUCH!The nifty little full color touchscreen (NOT to be confused with the e-paper reading screen, which is permanently gray-scale) just can't do it's job.  It responds slowly and inconsistently to touch, is quirky in its response, and virtually (no pun intended) unusable.  The virtual keyboard:  what a nightmare.  It's a true challenge to type more than one or two words without making an error, and trying to fix that error degenerates into a tragi-comedy in short order.The unit itself is pleasant to the hand, and comfortable.  It's also darn slick in its appearance, and if aesthetics  are your only criteria, well, go for it.  But here is why I returned the Nook after one week:  any optional feature, such as bookmarking, highlighting text and annotating it, search functions for previous book marks and annotations:  purely a nightmare.  The processor of the Nook appears to be vastly underpowered, and each instruction you give the touchscreen results in a wait that seems interminable.  It took me 30 seconds, AFTER I got good at it, to highlight 3 lines at the bottom of a page.  Simply not acceptable.Battery life:  might have just been my own unit, but in 7 hours: dead.  I also experienced two full scale lockups, with all buttons simply refusing to work for several minutes.The Nook's only advantage, as far as I can tell, is access to significantly more free content than you can currently access on Kindle.  Not worth the incredible frustration of wrestling with a device that went for touchscreen technology, but forgot that the touchscreen needs to be FUNCTIONAL before you bring it to market.Update as of 2/11/2010:  I purchased a Kindle after returning my Nook, and have been using it for three days.  Wow.  What an incredible difference in terms of ease of use.  The keyboard is very functional, bookmarking and note taking is effortless, the dictionary function (move the cursor to a word, instantly a definition pops up) is wonderful. Battery consumption is imperceptible, after 3 day, no visible drain (my Nook lasted 7 hours).  Downside of the Kindle?  Books whose copyright had expired (e.g. Wuthering Heights)that were FREE on Nook, are 99 cents on Kindle.  Nook lists all vendors of a given book, with prices conveniently visible, Kindle does not.  Irritating.  Lastly, Nook had a tiny clock in a corner of the screen, which I found very useful.  Not available on Kindle.

I went back and forth between Amazon's Kindle and B&N's NOOK.  The thing that sold me on the NOOK was the ability to download books from other sources than just Amazon.  I can download books from my local library, Google Books, along with Barnes & Noble's selection of over 2 million books they offer.  The ability to download any ePub and PDF files is a plus.  I like the touch pad vs. keyboard on Kindle.  It took a little getting used to as it is very touch sensitive, but once I got the hang of it, it is a smooth way to navigate.  One of the criticisms of NOOK has been some sluggishness with the NOOK, which I have maybe a tiny bit of, but we're talking maybe a second or so, so it is no big deal really.  There have been many criticisms about the battery life of the NOOK, but to me it's a minor thing as all I have to do is plug it in about every 4 or 5 days if I use my NOOK excessively.  It lasts longer if the WiFi is turned off.  I can go a week without having to recharge it then.  I also like the ability to replace the battery myself rather than having to send the the entire Kindle in to have it replaced.  One of the nicest features of the NOOK is being able to go into my local B&N bookstore and talking to a real live person if I have any questions or have any problem with my NOOK.  B&N has NOOK stations right in their stores with people who are there to answer questions or help with problems you may encounter.  They are very helpful.  The Kindle does not offer that kind of service.

Woehr", "helpful": [194, 199], "reviewText": "Despite all of the negative reviews, I decided to take a chance and buy the nook, once I tested it out at my local B&N.; I loved the look and feel of this device and was looking forward to the convenience of buying more books without adding more clutter to my already cluttered bookcases. I read all of the pros and cons of owning a Kindle and compared it to the pros and cons of owning a nook. The nook won because of its versatility (epub format, book lending, etc).My nook arrived on January 28th. Since then, I've experienced one crash and had to figure out how to use the touchscreen so that I can flip the pages without having to use the arrow keys. The latter took some practice, but I eventually mastered it and have been enjoying this feature ever since. I've also read three books in the space of a week, which is a personal record for me, as it normally takes two weeks for me to read a single paperback, longer if I'm reading an ebook on an LCD screen.The eInk technology is fabulous. I can read all day (and do) without eyestrain. The letters are very crisp on a plain white background. Even better, you can adjust the font size from small to extra large. Not only that but the nook comes with several fonts: Amasis, Helvetica Neue and Light Classic. I'm happy with the Amasis as it resembles Times Roman.My only complaint so far is that I am not able to categorize my books into categories. At the moment, I'm forced to wade through my list until I find the book that I want to read. B&N; has already sent out an update, which is a good improvement over the old interface. While the touch interface can be a bit buggy (Sometimes you have to flick your finger more than once or use the arrow keys to turn the page.), I can turn pages in one second compared to the 2-3 seconds it would take with the original software. That wasn't a big deal until I received the upgrade.I also like what they've done with the bookmarks feature. Before, they had a strange numerical format for bookmarks. With this upgrade, it lists the page that you bookmarked, which is much nicer.I love how I can download samples of ebooks directly from my nook without having to rely on the B&N; site to do everything. Once you finish the sample, you have the option to buy. If you decide to buy the book, you will be taken to the last page you read so that you can continue from there. You can also archive the books that you've read directly from your nook with the press of a button, which helps manage your list.Sideloading my pdf ebooks onto my nook was an easy experience. However, you can't categorize your documents; you can only sort them by title or author.Another great aspect of owning a nook is that you can check out ebooks from your local libraries (see [...] for a list of libraries near you), sideload books that you have bought from Fictionwise and other ebook stores, and download free ebooks from either the B&N; site or Google Books. That's what ultimately sold me on the nook, the versatility and freedom to choose where I want to buy or download free ebooks. The nook is not proprietary, unlike the Kindle and the soon-to-be-released iPad.The interface is very easy to use. It comes with a manual that you can read on the device, or on the B&N; website. If you're still stuck on an issue, I found this great forum ([...]) with friendly people who can help you.I've yet to check out the Lend feature because my family and friends have yet to embrace this technology.Other than my issue with organization, I am really enjoying my nook. I'm looking forward to reading many books in the future, thanks to this wonderful device. Highly recommended.Side note: I agree with S. Dayton about the iPad. After reading a few ebooks on my iTouch and my Mac, I have to agree with him about the eyestrain. For casual surfing and watching video, LCD works fine.

With all the buzz, I, of course, ran out to BN to see the Nook when it first came out and was incredibly disappointed at that time as it was painfully sluggish and I had almost crossed it off my list for purchase. However, I went back and saw it again at the store after about 6 weeks from my first viewing and what a difference! Barnes and Noble has made great strides. A friend showed me her Kindle and I got to play with it and I looked in stores and saw the Sony reader as well. Did MUCH research online as well on some of the others such as Jetbook Lite.As much as I LOVE Amazon and shop here more often than I probably should LOL. I decided on the Nook seeing the improvements that were already made in that short amount of time. What sealed the deal for me was the SD card option to expand memory AND you can change the battery yourself as opposed to having to send your device back over a simple battery change.I am not regretting my decision to go with the Nook at all. I have to admit that it did freeze up on me twice, BUT it only did that when I interrupted the charging process. So, I don't know exactly what caused that. No problems at all while reading. As far as reading on the Nook, its a great device. Downloading books is fast and simple to do. Page turning is fast now. Its a dream come true for an avid reader like me.The only con that I've noticed so far is battery life. I think its a huge stretch to say the battery lasts 10 days. However, the wi-fi turns itself off after being idle for a minute or so, so you don't have to manually turn it off. When you activate the menu, it will reconnect to the network. So, BN is making an effort to increase battery life without much manual interaction.I highly recommend the Nook.

She loves it and uses it more than any other gift I ever purchased her. She was having so much fun with it I decided to get an ereader for myself but I was drawn more toward the Nook. I read so many bad reviews about the Nook I wasn't sure if I should get it or a Kindle or maybe something different with a touch screen and wireless connection. I thought about it for a few weeks and noticed that the reviews started getting better. I decided to go for it. I ordered it last Wednesday from B&N; and received it 2 days later. I am so happy I did. I didn't experience any of the the negatives I read about with exception that battery could stay charged longer. Talking about the battery, it's nice to know that you can change it yourself and at a much lessor expense than with a Kindle. I'll probably never need it but it's also nice to be able to add a memory card to hold more content. And the Nook just looks nicer in my opinion.The new update was released the same day I received my Nook and I updated the firmware the second day I had it and it runs even more smoother. I have been a gadget man all my life but this is my first touch screen device. I had no problems what-so-ever navigating the menus and the menus changed fast enough for me.My wife still loves her Kindle but I think she is a little jealous. She asked me why I didn't get her a Nook for Christmas.I was completely in the dark about ereaders until just 2 months ago. I know during my research I found people that were experiencing  problems and were unhappy with every reader I checked into. If you were putting off getting a Nook because of bad reviews, I would give them another look. There has been 2 firmware updates already that probably addressed many of the earlier concerns. That's not bad for a device that was only released a short while ago.

I bought the Nook for these reasons: 1) It reads industry-standard ePub-format ebooks, 2) it's tightly integrated with the B&N; ebook store, 3) the ebooks are encrypted in a well-documented easily-understood format that is portable across multiple devices so they can be decrypted and read in, say, your iPad's Nook reader software, or even in a Sony Reader (with the very latest firmware), without having to be re-purchased because of DRM nonsense.The problem is that the Nook simply doesn't live up to its promise. The \"paper-white\" display is more an off-beige, and reflects light in a way that makes it hard to read with a reading light (necessary because it has no backlight, as is true for all ePaper devices). It's heavy and the buttons to change pages are hard to push, especially with gloved hands as you might have while reading outdoors on a cool day. The \"5 day battery life\" in reality for me has been a 1-day battery life, read a book, and it needs to be recharged, and be darn sure to turn it off. The thing freezes up and crashes all the time even with the very latest software, and is excruciatingly slow even with the very latest software. The latest software added classifications for the ebooks so you could sort them into pseudo-folders, which is necessary given how excruciatingly slow the Nook is to scroll through its book list (get about 50 books on the list and you're in for major pain), but the clunky way they implemented this makes those of us who've gotten used to modern user interfaces frown and shake our heads.Sad to say, I really can't recommend any current eBook reader. Either they're too clumsy to use (Nook), have no books available for them (Sony), or have a proprietary eBook format that locks you into a single vendor (Kindle). I'm seriously considering buying an iPad, yes, it will only work for 9 hours or so on a battery charge, but that's true of the Nook too in real actual use and the iPad is usable for a lot of other things too. It's just disappointing that I can't get an ePaper-based reader that meets my criteria (non-proprietary ebook format, long battery life, compact, decent user interface), and instead have things either crippled by bad design decisions or crippled by having a proprietary ebook format that locks you into a single vendor.

I begin to research e readers.. I even went to the store and tested the nook, played with it. I went to other stores that had other e readers and looked at them as well. Then one of my coworkers showed me her Kindle and I was able to play with it and look at it.Then the i pad came out, So I went to the store and looked at the i pad and played with it as well. I have read review after review and watched you-tube...Well The holidays came and my husband bought me the Nook!!! I was so excited! I wanted the Nook as soon as I saw it, but took my time and compared it to other e readers.. I knew right from the start which e reader I wanted after being in discussion with others about e readers and after looking and playing with a few of them.Right out of the box the Nook, made me happy and gave me confirmation of my long desire to own the Nook. My husband knew that I wanted it, but I waited trying to justify why I needed an e reader and to see if anyone of them would go beyond my expectations. The Nook did exactly that! For me the Nook was worth the money and time it took to decide on which one to purchase... Here is why I love the Nook, I can lend books to other, I can download from my library which is so awesome! I can surf the net for FREE!!!!!! no monthly fees like the i pad, It fits in my computer bag, purse, which makes it so easy to take with me, It has my favorite games, Chess and Sukodu! It was easy for me to download a ebook that I already have, but have been unable to read due to me not wanting to tote my lap top around, the book loaded right from my lap top to the Nook in no time... The amount of free books that are available to the Nook, and the daily free treats from Barnes And Nobles! Which will more than pay for the Nook over time. Being able to call Barnes and Nobles and talk to a live person over the phone and being able to walk in the store and get face to face customer service.I also like the fact that when you are in the store you can read ebooks for free for an hour and download more free ebooks!

I can not say enough about the Nook, I don't have to be tied to one book store like Itunes, Ibook, are the Kindle store... I don't like limits and the Nook allows me to be free to choose where to get my books from...Now with that said, When I visited my local Barnes and Nobles and received a free smoothie, It was so stress free and everyone was so nice.. I could not believe it!I have also downloaded music that I can listen to and have my ear plugs for that, I have also downloaded several books which was so easy to download that I was shocked! I like getting my monies worth, and not having to pay extra monthly fees.Now with that said, I hope that when you do your research you will consider the Nook, I am surprised that there are not more reviews than the current number of reviews.

With my library card I can download epub books and check them out, anywhere I've got internet.  I don't have to check them back in, they just go away after the check out period.  Same with Audiobooks.  Nook handles this format, other eReaders do not, so you might want to look into this option and what formats the readers have before making a decision.I like the onscreen keyboard/touch screen, personally.  It is bright and easy in areas where dimly lit and the light in your reader case is directed at the reading screen.  Seems like no big deal, but after 28 hours on a plane you get tired and this makes a difference.Not a bunch of keys to hit/press with the keyboard exposed.  This is a personal opinion, and I can absolutely understand why others may want the keyboard.  I put in pagemarks etc on books, but don't type a lot of notes into the ebooks when reading.  If you do a lot of this, you may want to test run the onscreen keyboard and see if you like it.  I don't, the amount of typing is very limited, so onscreen is perfect and I'm used to it with my phones.Using this over wifi to surf the internet is something you can do, but it isn't the best.

The battery life is misrepresented by B&N.; The only way you could possibly get 10 days out of the battery is if it is off. However, 2 to 4 days is a real possibility, So, bring your charger or USB to computer cable. Just like Apple IPOD, the B&N; folks decided to use a non-standard USB cable that appears to match the Apple ones. This is a minor problem, but do not expect to borrow a USB cable from someone while on travel. The included small charger worked very well.The key thing is how does the NOOK function as a book reader. In my opinion, it is adequate, and no more. I downloaded a number of free books without any problem. I also downloaded some paid books form B&N.; Once again, no problem. Finally, I downloaded some books from my public library onto my computer (not the NOOK)using the free Adobe software. Using the USB cable to my NOOK, I simply dragged the books to the NOOK, and voila, two seocnds later they were available for 14 days. So far so good. One could now rant about the interface (so-so), or the fact that you should reduce the color-screen brightness to about 10% to save the battery as well as turn off the WI-FI when not in use, and so forth, but how does it work when reading a book.If you are like me, and read fairly fast, most books will be a real page turners, since there is not much on a page compared to a real print on paper book. The print is clear. It is faily black on a slightly grey background (some might say off-white), which under a bright reading light is quite comfortable. For the eyesight challenged, there are bigger fonts accompanied with still more page turning. The same is true of the KINDLE. Page turning is easy and intuitive, so not a problem. Use the buttons on the side, not the color interface.A big feature of the NOOK is the ability to add a memory card. Well it is true you can do this, but it is not for the faint of heart or fingernail impaired. The first time you try to open the NOOK using the nearly invisible tab, you will wonder if you are going to break the cover. Just be careful, follow the instructions, and all will be well. Now, why would you want to add memory. As it arrives, the NOOK holds a huge number of books. You might want to add some of your work in PDF documents - this chews up space fast - and the pdf reading capability is primitive at best. Get a small netbook for this purpose and leave the NOOK for books. Changing the battery-RIGHT! Perhaps at the end of life, 2 to 3 years, to save a service trip. By then the technology will be antique, and you will replace the whole NOOK, not just the battery.A disappointment is the lack of even a primitive browser so that you could check email without lugging along another computer. The KINDLE has this feature. The NOOK can be \"upgraded\" to also have a browser, but then it is non-standard, and you might have trouble as B&N; upgrades the official firmware. Perhaps B&N; will relent and give us email capability similar to the APPLE I-Touch. I can understand not wanting to overload AT&T; with too much traffic, but simple text emails should not have been a problem.Finally, why would you want a NOOK in the first place. Remember, real books use no power, are truly random access, can be lent to anyone for as long as you like, and will function far into the future regardless of technology changes. The only purpose I can see for having a NOOK is for travel and for electronically borrowing books from a library without getting into your car or walking overmuch. Well, scratch the last, since you can borrow and read books on your computer. The airplane travel or train commute is a biggie. Books are heavy and bulky. Carrying 6 books onto an airplane is a pain. Plus, hauling out your NOOK to read makes you look technically COOL, and for the short term, is sure to start a conversation with a nearby stranger. The conversation might be interesting and better than the NOOK-book you were going to read.Well, I've written enough and am going to read a book that I just downloaded from the local library. I'll try not spill my soup on the NOOK while reading and eating -or it would become a SOUPER-NOOK.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A HALF COOKED NOOK", "unixReviewTime": 1263686400, "reviewTime": "01 17, 2010"}

Initially, I liked it, but I quickly learned that the battery life wasn't nearly the quoted time (it lasts about 2 days for me, 3 max with wireless off and the most power-saving settings). The e-ink/lcd screen mix was nice for navigation, although I understand that the newer touch models will be more battery-efficient. Despite this drawback, it was so much more convenient than paperbacks. As much as I love the feel of books, in a NYC apartment, there just isn't all that much room for them!That nook lived for about 9 months until a part of the screen died - just black pixels. I called customer service and after a long painful process, got it replaced. The unit I got was clearly a refurbished unit, which wouldn't have bothered me, had it been identical to the one I sent it. My original nook had a two-part screen, this new nook had a one-part screen and its' buttons squeaked when pressed. Little did I know at the time that this was the sign of a very important defect! As it happened, this 'squeaking', which made the buttons difficult to press, also caused the page-turn buttons to crack just one month past warranty. Needless to say, I wasn't delighted. Apparently, the page-turn buttons cracking is a very common defect. So if you buy a nook, remember this: if the button squeaks and is hard to press, it will break. Return it while you can. Not all the nooks are like this (my old one wasn't), so I recommend checking it out.Overall - 3/5 - it's a solid reading device but doesn't really compare to the new-generation nook simple touch/kindle touch devices or even the Kindle 3 keyboard (which I now also own).", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Nice device but battery and Customer Service problems", "unixReviewTime": 1322352000, "reviewTime": "11 27, 2011"}

The one and only reason I chose Nook (instead of just sticking with and upgrading my beloved old Kindle 1) is its ability to download books from the public library. Tomorrow I am taking the Nook back to Best Buy for a refund, not an exchange. The Nook is attractive and nicely packaged. I completely expected it to just work, like my Kindle did (and still does) and all of my Apple products do. But, like so many other reviewers here, my Nook never even got up and running before it croaked. First, it would not complete the registration process. I have an active account on B&N; and strong WiFi in my home, plus this Nook also has 3G so there were not any connection problems. Then, when I decided to just register later and moved on to explore how the Nook worked, it froze. Could not reboot or turn it off by holding down power key as suggested in the troubleshooting help/support on the B&N; website. It did not work. I do not want to mess with taking the back off, using little screwdrivers or whatever to take out (the fully charged) battery, etc. We should not have to do that on a brand new 200.00 product! So, am taking it back and won't buy another until they improve the quality of the thing. I never had one bit of trouble with my trusty Kindle, and would not even be looking at another brand of reader except for Kindle's inability to download library books.  I'm giving the Nook two stars instead of one because, if it actually worked, it looks like it would be a nice ereader and it has a more open format than Kindle does.Update: 1/28/11Went to return the Nook for a refund today and at the last minute decided to give it another go, so did exchange instead. Tonight charged and powered up the replacement Nook, so far so good. It works perfectly. Registration was smooth and fast, wifi connected easily with my signal, downloaded a book quickly, and navigation is a breeze.  No problems encountered yet except that it is not downloading an available firmware update, and there's probably some explanation for that so not a big deal.  So, I might just end up keeping this baby as a companion to my Kindle. Love having the Nook with its open format for library and other downloads. Will see how it holds up over the next several weeks and then update my rating accordingly.Update: 2/3/11Returned the Nook to Best Buy today and bought a Kindle 3 through Amazon. After exchanging the first defective Nook then using its replacement for several days I found that the device worked pretty much as it was supposed to. There are a couple of minor things about it that I was not crazy about and probably would have gotten used to, but there is one problem (design flaw?) that for me is definitely a deal killer. One of the minor annoyances is that there is a lot of screen flash during any menu change. Another is that the color, lighted touch screen control at the bottom of the device is distracting when it lights up at any touch during reading. And after a while I was not that crazy about the menu navigation either, seemed like too many steps and screen flashes, but probably could have gotten used to that too. I would not have rejected the Nook just over those little quirks. The big reason that the Nook was no way going to work out for me is, again, that touch screen display at the bottom of the device. It is, like an iPad, highly reflective. So what that means is that when the screen is off, which it is most all of the time during reading, you can watch yourself read! The black screen reflects anything in front of it, almost like a dark mirror. That was a no go for me, no I did not like it at all. Aside from these annoyances, the Nook did well at everything it was designed to do. So will upgrade the rating to reflect (haha) that. I have to say that I am much happier with the Kindle, but Amazon really needs to get with the program and let Kindle use the epub format. They will eventually lose me and a lot of other prospective customers over the epub problem, it is that big of a deal.Yet another update! 5/31/11Caved in and purchased another Nook last week. I still love my Kindle and prefer it over Nook, but just could not wait another minute for Amazon to open Kindle to ePub for downloading public library books. So, last week when B&N; had Nooks for sale cheap on their eBay website (99.00, free ship, 3g/wifi, non-color, refurb w/ full warranty) I jumped on it. This refurb Nook worked much better out of the box than my initial brand new device purchased then returned back in Jan/Feb. I am using the Nook just for library books, and it does what it's supposed to do. Navigation works well, but seems like it requires more step than Kindle. Still do not like the reflective color screen below the reading area. There is one thing that I do like better on Nook, the screen background is a paler gray than Kindle making for easier reading in low light. I will keep this Nook until Amazon does ePub, then stick with Kindle.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Kindle lover jumps ship for a few hours", "unixReviewTime": 1296086400, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2011"}

Salinger, MSN, FNP, RN AHN-BC", "helpful": [16, 17], "reviewText": "There are a multitude of reviews that compare and contrast the Nook and Kindle, so I'm not going to go into a full-blown comparison and review. I'm going to focus on my experience owning both, most specifically battery life and availability of books.My husband uses the kindle and I use the Nook. The reason I went with the Nook is because initially I was very \"anti\" non-paper book. He wanted a kindle and I sneered at the idea. I was being a book snob and didn't like the idea of books in electronic format, so I snubbed my nose at it.However, after we took a vacation and he had his kindle loaded with books, and I had 8-10 big paper books, I began to reconsider my position.  Upon return from our vacation I elected to get a Nook. I did so because I liked the idea of the touch screen at the bottom rather than the keyboard, which I thought made the kindle look klunky. I thought overall that the Nook was more aesthetically pleasing. So - I ordered the nook.There are two major things that the kindle has on the Nook, and that is far superior battery life, and significantly more books available for download - especially so if you read non-fiction.The battery life on my Nook is awful. So much so that I ordered a new battery thinking perhaps I had a dud. Nope - it's performance is just the same. If I am actively reading a book I have to recharge  every 3 days. If I don't read it for 10-14 days it will drain on it's own. Comparing this to my husband's kindle, he can go an entire 2 week trip reading books daily without having to recharge his kindle! It takes a couple months to drain with no usage. The kindle's battery life is mega-much more than my Nook. I have serious battery life envy. For that alone I've begun to covet his kindle.The second bummer is that most of the available books for Nook are fiction. There are some of the more popular non-fiction type books available. Usually whatever is most trendy at the time, but for the most part any professional type texts, or anything not on a best seller list that is non-fiction can't be found for the Nook platform. However, when I go to Amazon, 8 of 10 times, I'll find it available for download on the kindle.BUT! One thing about this is that for me, I tend to mark up and highlight my non-fiction books a lot because I'm using them for reference sources. It is very difficult to quickly retrieve highlighted text from the electronic source compared to my real, paper books. So I've actually come to realize that I'd likely be purchasing my non-fiction as real paper books anyways, so that I can have them for ready reference and mark them up with my highlights and little flags (yes - I'm a geek who uses the little flag tabs to mark pages in my books!) So, I'm now fine with the fact that I can't readily download non-fiction to my Nook and instead I continue to buy them as regular, paper books. As I said above, I'd likely buy my non-fiction as real books anyways since I use them as references.I now download all my fiction books to the Nook. So it's become my source for pleasure reading, which is great, since that is the kind of stuff I take with me when I travel or about town anyways, and can just stuff the Nook in my purse.However, I VERY MUCH ENVY THE BATTERY LIFE OF THE KINDLE! If I could stuff a kindle battery into my Nook I'd be a super happy girl.If I had it to do over I'd likely buy a kindle for myself despite it's less aesthetically pleasing appearance. The battery life and availability of books is far superior to the Nook.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Extra info to consider between Nook & Kindle (I own both)", "unixReviewTime": 1285459200, "reviewTime": "09 26, 2010"}

Reads PDF (both scanned and standard text) and EPUB book formats with no hassles or conversion required. In-store help and extra features from B&N.; Page turning speed is much improved with most recent update. Android OS allows for almost unlimited software improvements and added features. Replacement batteries can be bought and installed easily. Accepts SD cards for increased storage capacity (this really comes in handy if you want to use the device as an mp3 player or for audiobooks).Cons: eInk display requires you to operate at a bit slower pace than the touchscreen alone would allow. (Also: Not sure why the price from this supplier is abnormally high?)I've played with an iPad and it's a very fun device. But what I don't like is a glowing backlit screen, as I look at a monitor all day. When I read, I want to relax and give my eyes a break, and that's why I prefer eInk displays.The Nook's primary advantage over the Kindle is that it allows you to read EPUB and PDF books (scanned or text; either works) and buy books from various online ebook stores, including the Sony Reader store. This has already allowed me to read two titles that I wouldn't have been able to get for the Kindle. It also works very easily with Adobe Digital Editions software, a huge plus. Currently Amazon offers some titles that B&N; does not (a very temporary state of affairs, I suspect), but those are usually available from Sony.Add the book loan feature, free library books, and the ability to take it to a B&N; store for bonus features, and this unit pretty much stomps the Kindle and Sony readers.The Nook is a little slower than a phone or your other electronic devices due to the e-Ink screen, but once you get used to it, the device seems very smooth. In fact, I find that having to slow down a little actually helps me relax, and once you master turning pages with a quick brush of the thumb across the touchscreen, reading with the Nook is a very pleasant experience.

This is the second update to the Nook since launch.  All I can say is THANK YOU Barnes & Noble!The LCD screen improvements alone are GREAT!  With better looking icons, more responsiveness, and a sleeker appearance -- it makes me think of that McDonald's commercial: I'm lovin' it!Several of the well documented issues have been fixed, such as losing bookmarks due to powering off the unit -- which as it turns out was the most cited problem for Nook bashers and haters alike.  Nook haters will also be disappointed that the battery life has been optimized too.All-in-all if you've been waiting for the minor 1.0 issues to be fixed prior to purchasing the Nook you will not be disappointed in this newest version.  And if you have been considering switching from the Kindle you would be well advised to do so at this point.*****************************************************************************Updated 01/31/2010*****************************************************************************This device is clearly the best option on the market today, with it's LCD touchscreen, Wi-fi, memory expansion capabilities, and so, so much more. Let's \"wade in the weeds\" and look at some of the features in detail:LCD TouchscreenSo far this is the only mainstream reader to offer a LCD screen of any kind. The Coverflow-like book cover listing is beautiful, elegant, and functional. With the newest update it is uber fast, intuitive, and responsive. Page turns are super easy with the touchscreen, all you have to do is swipe the screen with one finger when it's in standby mode and the page turns.  In addition, it's easier for me to navigate books via the LCD than textually. Seeing the cover is a really nice feature, since books are designed to pique your interest by the cover. It just seems like a good cover sells a book, and seeing that cover in crisp LCD sells me from time to time.The keyboard is nice, any time a text field comes up you will have the keyboard pop up on queue. It's fast, responsive, and best of all doesn't look like a 1970's era fax machine keypad like some of the older readers on the market.Wi-fiThe built in Wi-fi is one of the great features of this device. Modern 3G speeds are pretty fast, but as most of us know that have smartphones, Wi-fi is about 100 times faster, especially when one tries to download large things, or a lot of content. The Wi-fi on this device is no exception... it's fast and super easy to set up. The on screen instructions are sooo clear to follow. I couldn't imagine only having 3G these days, like when you are in an area that doesn't have 3G coverage, you can still use the Nook over Wi-fi.  This is truly one of the killer features of the Nook.  You can go into a B&N; store and Wi-fi to your hearts content, but then come home and do the same.  Hotels offering free Wi-fi are the Nooks biach.Memory ExpansionThe Nook has a Micro-SD card slot which accepts up to 16GB Micro-SD cards, this allows you to upgrade your memory indefinitely. Another advantage would be to organize your books. And books on the card are never going to get lost if your reader dies -- without having to re-download from the cloud.  Plus with the new B&N; desktop reader you can move your books from the Nook to a laptop/netbook on the fly, and what if the worst should happen and your eReader dies?  You still have those books on the card.AppearanceThis is a biggy for me as it is for most people... I don't tend to buy or use things that look ugly. That's why I've got an iPod instead of a Zune, why I've got a LCD TV instead of a CRT, and now why I've got a Nook instead of another reader. The appearance of this device can be described with one word, SEXY. It just looks good. Other readers currently available range from looking \"not too bad\" to looking downright ugly. This reader is the exception to that rule and employs a host of features to boot.Book formats and availabilityThis is probably the biggest of all the features, since we are talking about a book reader, the Nook boasts a whopping 1,000,000 books available for it, in readily readable format, from just two sources (B&N; and Google). The nearest competitor only offers 500,000 books in it's native format (Kindle). You can convert many books to a Kindle readable format, but it's a hassle and you have to use your computer to do that. Sort of defeats the purpose of the wireless if you have to constantly connect to the PC. And there are third party sources for books in Kindle format, probably websites you've never heard of, new sites pop up all the time since Kindle has a big install base, but the quality of books on those sites is in question compared to a reputable company like Google.eInk displayIt seems to be crisper than much of the competition out there. The ability to change the typeface and size of the fonts is wonderful. The nearest competitors screen almost seems fuzzy in comparison, which for me makes it harder to read. Page changes are fast on the Nook, while nothing can compare with the speed of changing a real books' page, it's fast enough for the average person. Speed readers may find themselves waiting for a few milliseconds though. The controls on the Nook are straightforward and intuitive.Replacable batteryThis is another biggy for most ebook people, with the Nook you can change the battery out should you A) want extended reading times without charge, or B) if the original battery dies for some reason.  Many of the other readers on the market do not allow this, which means they are bricked if the battery dies and will either have to be repaired or replaced.Battery lifeA lot has been said about the battery life of the Nook, and other eReaders.  All of the manufacturers of these devices overstate the real world battery life in real world useage situations.  I have a co-worker with one of the Amazon (Kindle Brand) eReaders and he has to charge every 3 - 4 days.  Nook lasts for me about 5 - 7 days, but it all depends on what features you use on either or any of the devices and how much you use them to determine actual, real world battery usage. Either way, all of these devices are easy to charge.  Just plug into a standard 110 - 120 outlet and PRESTO!  Or in the case of the Nook, you can also plug into your computer/laptop/netbook and VOILA!  You will be on go in no time flat.Ease of useThe Nook is easy to set up and use, The onscreen keyboard is more familiar and similar to modern devices than many of the competitors setups.SummaryThere are so many features of this device it's hard to capture them all in one review. All in all this is one great device, with it's iPod like look and feel, large number of built in features, and industry standard operating system, it's clearly the choice of discerning electronics customers.*******************************Update*******************************So, I had been told on these comments that the B&N; in store functionality was not ready to be used yet -- another lie dispelled today.  I stopped in at the B&N; in Hillsboro and it is in fact fully functional.  My Nook immediately recognized the B&N; network and connected without me even having to tell it to!  As it turns out there is exclusive content at each B&N; store, at this particular one there were multiple books that could be downloaded for FREE!!!  So, seeing one that piqued my interest I naturally downloaded it.

I actually waited until the Nook Color was announced before opening the box - I wanted to see what the new gadget had to offer and if it'd be worth trading mine in.There were some rumors that the Nook Color would feature a screen with Mirasol technology, and I was disappointed to learn that it actually had an LCD screen coated with something to reduce glare. I state at an LCD screen all day at work, and don't want to do the same while reading. Plus, I'm not sure how well the LCD screen would fare in the sun and I'm interested to hear feedback from Nook Color owners.I think the color screen matters if you want to read a lot of magazines, or textbooks, or kids' books, none of which I'll be doing. Nook Color also stores more books (6000) and allows the reader to send updates to Facebook and Twitter directly from the eReader. Personally, I didn't find any of these extra features particularly appealing, so I'm happily sticking with the original Nook.My Observations/Pros of the Nook-It's bigger than I expected, in a good way. It's not heavy, but has a nice \"significant\" feel to it.-I think few people realize how clear and book-like the e-Ink screen actually is. I showed the Nook to some friends, and that was the first thing they noticed.-The bottom LCD touch-screen adds a little oomph with the color buttons and book covers.-Getting ePub books from the public library has been surprisingly easy, although you have to connect the Nook to a computer in order to transfer the ePub files.-I've been enjoying the Nook Facebook group where administrators post a free eBook every Friday.-The instructional videos online are very helpful in getting started with the Nook.Cons-BN.com has a Free NookBooks section, but for some reason, not all the free eBooks are listed. I saw some Kindle titles that were available for free, and when I searched on BN.com, turns out they were free there as well.-I didn't care much about the LendMe feature of the Nook, but it was still disappointing to learn that not all purchased eBooks can be lent out. Publishers control which titles can be used for lending, and each book can only be lent out once....ever.-The PDF manual for the Nook is very confusing and can benefit from some serious editing.-There are definitely more Kindle books than NookBooks available, but I hope that will change in the near future.All in all, I am pretty happy with the Nook and I think the fact that it supports a wider range of eBook formats outweighs many of the cons.

Sold it last fall and got 1 girl a Kindle Fire 2nd gen, and the other a Lenovo A2107. The Lenovo was absolutely horrid so I wanted to replace it. This summer, when the Nook HD got Google Play, and the prices fell, I sold the Lenovo and got my daughter the Nook HD 16gb Snow. She absolutely loves it! I liked it so much, I got the Nook HD 8gb for myself. I like it much better than my Kindle Fire HD. The size is smaller, and thinner, and lighter, which are great things. And you can put whatever wallpaper you want on it, unlike the Fire HD.I sold the 2nd gen Kindle Fire and gave the other daughter the Fire HD, but she has since switched to a Nook also (HD+). So now I have the Fire HD and the Nook HD for myself. I like the Nook HD better for the reasons stated above. Size and weight are so much smaller on the Nook HD. The screen resolution is also better. There is nothing I don't like about the Nook HD. I did put a GreatShield Glare Screen protector on the Nooks, to reduce the shiny glare. We use them without cases, just sleeves. They are phenomenal tablets.If you or the person you are buying for loves to play games and will likely download hundreds of them, definitely get the 16gb Nook HD. You will want as much space for apps as you can afford, despite the SD card slot. Games have to be installed to internal memory, for the most part. The SD card slot comes in handy for books, movies, photos and music. I got the 8 gb Nook HD for myself, because I don't play games, the only apps I need are for reading, playing music, news, web, stuff like that. I put my files on the SD card and I am set!I don't plan to buy the new Fires when they come out.  They are far too limited, in my opinion. (So was the Nook, of course, until they added Google Play). I have ADW Launcher on all three of the Nooks, though my daughters tend to prefer the standard Nook launcher. What shows up on that home page can be customized to show only what you want it to show. There is also an \"app drawer\" icon that shows the most recently opened apps for easy launching.

The price is starting to creep up for a new one so keep your eyes open for a sale, but don't wait too long because they are no longer being manufactured.There are two primary reasons that I like the Nook HD+ 9\". First of course is the 1920 x 1280 high resolution display.  You will note that  by comparison 1080p is only 1920 x 1080 so this display is 4x3 not 16x9.  In my opinion the extra pixels make browsing web pages more pleasant in both portrait and landscape mode.  The second reason is that this tablet was sold in large numbers so developers have released ROM builds with the latest version of Android KitKat.  These can be used either by flashing the tablet's ROM internally or running KitKat from a micro SD Card and leaving the Nook's original operating system untouched.We have numerous Android devices and were able to download everything we needed for free, but their are companies who sell micro SD cards already set up for around $20.  So for a reasonable price one can get a \"rooted\" android tablet without doing much research and with almost no risk to the tablet or your warranty.This tablet was originally released in November of 2012.  It has a 1.5 GHz OMAP4470 Dual-Core Processor which is a little slower than the Samsung Exynos 4412 dual-core 1.5GHz processor found in the Galaxy Tab 3 8\" that was released in a few months later in mid 2013.  The processor is good enough to play most formats of HD Video, but struggles with games with 3D graphics.  It performs better with the rooted version of KitKat than with the stock Nook OS.We had a Galaxy Tab 3 8\" and now have a Galaxy Tab 4 8\".  They both have a very good GPS and cameras in the front and rear.  The Nook has neither of these features.  But the bigger display with 1920x1280 resolution as compared to 1280x800 on the Galaxy Tabs more than makes up for these shortcomings for most of what we use a tablet for.Many of these were sold so there is a very good support network.  Lots of accessories are available through Amazon and the other usual suspects.  The hardware has proven to be dependable despite a few people who have reported problems here.  They come with a good warranty and extended warranties are available.  I am giving it 5 stars not because it is the greatest tablet ever made, but because at this time at the prices they are going for on sale... it is the best tablet value that I am currently aware of.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Value!

If you want a wizbang then you don't want the Nook HD.  For me it fit all my needs without needing a loan to buy one.  I ordered my direct from B & N for $179.00.  It came pre registered in my wifes account who has the nook color.  It is very easy to create your own profile and not see all the junk your spouse has but, at the same time can pick what you want that they have.  No need to repurchase what they already have.What Barnes and Nobel doesn't really want you to know is that you can put Amazon's Kindle app on the nook and read Kindle books (both free and purchased from Amazon).  I also noted that, with the Kindle app, you can adjust the fonts and resize PDF documents that you cannot do on the nook when reading PDF's.Lets not forget its a 9 in screen.  Battery holds well at 10 hours.I bought a 32GB SD card and so far have put 15 movies ( and stiil room for many more) on the card to watch in HD. I choose to save the memory on the nook for books or other apps and watch my movies from the tiny SD micro card. Buy \"DVD Catalyst\" ( really cool program for $9.95)(can try it for free)on line to compress those movies from DVD and then it automatically puts it on the micro card.I seen some gripes about them adding Google store.  Not sure how you can complain about ading a whole another facet of apps.  IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT THEN DON'T ADD ANY GOOGLE APPS. Its still a free country.So for reading ebooks, movies, games, apps and many others all for $179.00, for me it hit my tickle spot.

The screen quality is beautiful.  I already have an Apple 4th generation iPad, but I couldn't resist on the high quality picture and low price.  After I received the Nook, I immediately rooted with Kit Kat, the latest operating system.  Let me tell you, I am glad that I made the move.  The original Ice Cream Sandwich OS has lag but not Kit Kat.  With Kit Kat, not only the Nook operates much more smoothly, you also get the full Android tablet experience and more apps available from Google Play.I recently stumbled across the XBMC Cine Player Android app in the Google Play store.  With this app, I can now stream over 1500 movies in HD quality for free.  I have been using XBMC for a little while now on both MacBook Pro and Raspberry Pi, though the Cine Player version's library is not as extensive as the MacBook Pro and Raspberry Pi, it is good enough for use when you are on the road like in a hotel or something.  With Kit Kat, I experience very little buffering issue. I can also output contents to a TV via the Nook HDMI adapter.  I believe you can output signal to a TV via Google Chromecast but I haven't tried it yet so I can't be for sure.I highly recommend the Nook if you root it with the latest OS.  I am finding more and more things that I can do with the Nook then the iPad due to Android is an open system.By the way, I use N2A to root my two Nook HD+'s.  With a N2A micro SD card, it gives you the dual boot capabilities.  You can use it to boot Kit Kat or the native Barnes and Noble OS without removing the card.  The N2A card doesn't replace the native OS as the Kit Kat OS is stored in the micro SD card so you don't have to be concerned about voiding the warranty from alternating the tablet OS.Bottom line, the Nook HD+ is already a pretty decent tablet.  One can greatly improve its potential with a simple change to the OS.  If front and back cameras and GPS are not necessities for you, the Nook is a good value tablet for 1/3 of the cost of an iPad.  By the way, I bought an external bluetooth GPS for $16 and it works like a charm with the Nook.  One can expect to spend $100 for an external bluetooth GPS if your IOS device doesn't come with an internal GPS.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Well worth every penny if rooted with Kit Kat", "unixReviewTime": 1400976000, "reviewTime": "05 25, 2014"}

Now that it is being offered at new prices ($150-180) and has been upgraded to support Google Play Android apps as well as B&N; content, the value proposition is much improved.  (Yes, you will have to be patient and let your Nook HD+ do a couple a major software updates before you can really settle down and enjoy your new toy!  But it's worth the wait.)If you are coming from other Nook devices, you'll feel right at home.  If not, you may be surprised to find the combined \"reader\" and \"Android tablet\" interface pretty nice.  It's well thought out and for the most part works very well.  Take your time and be willing to explore a bit and you'll soon get the hang if  it.  Don't miss the \"Nook Today\" icon which is a clever one, but easily overlooked.  All in all, I was very comfortable with it in a short time and actually find the UI a bit of a refreshing change.  (Occasionally, you have to use the home key instead of just \"back\" but a minor quibble.) [Note: You can \"override\" the Nook UI and install other \"launchers\" but I, personally, felt no need to do so.  But nice to know the option is there if ever needed.]The size is a nice compromise between the smaller units (too small for comfortable long video watching) and the larger units (big, heavy, bulky).  The 8-9\" range seems to be the sweet spot.  The FULL HD (1920x1080 256ppi) screen is gorgeous with great colors and contrast and sufficient brightness.  Videos/movies, YouTube, Photos, Graphics, all look great.  The high quality screen is the big draw here, in my opinion.  Excellent value at the new price point.The size, weight (very light for this size device), slimness, and easy handling are all good points of this tablet.  Some do not like the Nook hole on the bottom left, but I am fine with it.  It gives a bit of orientation, an easy place to grab the tablet, and so on.  The styling looks good to me and the slimness is nice and makes it easy to hold and handle.HD YouTube and Netflix look wonderful.  This is absolutely one of the best tablets for the price if you want to watch Netflix on the go.  I was able to hook up my portable bluetooth speakers without any problems, so the movies sounded great as well.  Bluetooth headphones also worked well as did regular headphones, of course.  The built in speaker(s) is OK, but not sufficient for best music and movie sound quality (as is true with most tablets).The controls are well placed, simple, and easy to use.  The MicroSD card slot is a nice bonus so you can expand your storage easily and is a feature missing from many tablets.  The proprietary charging port is a minus, a standard USB would have been more flexible, but it works well and charges faster.  The handy \"HOME\" button with the Nook logo is very useful and also works well.There are no cameras - and I could care less, but some might.  I'll take the superb screen, great design and build, and other nice features and be happy.  For the techies, it uses 1.5 GHz dual-core OMAP 4470 proc and 1 GB of RAM.  Not cutting edge, but plenty fast.  Benchmarks I checked were all pretty good and the Nook HD+ is very responsive in use. The back features a nice \"soft touch\" feel that I really like versus many tablets that have a slick back making them prone to being easily dropped.The recent update adds the Chrome browser to the NOOK HD+ and web browsing is snappy and works well.  Everything looks great, of course, on the FULL HD screen and the Chrome browser handles most web pages with aplomb, formatting them nicely for the Nook HD+.  Chrome will also sync and update your bookmarks and such across devices, automatically, which is nice.If you like Barnes & Noble and their books and movie content, then, of course, that is a win for you as well.  It's all here and well integrated.  Plus there are some Nook HD+ specific apps pre-installed and you should prefer them in most cases.  (Note: I made the mistake of updating the Nook Netflix app with the one from the Google Play store -- big No-No!  It did not work at all.  Once I uninstalled it and went back and reloaded the Nook-branded version from the Nook store (free) -- everything worked fine again. I've had this issue with other tablets as well, the Netflix app seems to be very picky and you need the right one for your specific tablet. I had also installed the Android Pandora over the Nook version, but that one worked fine.  So...if you do this and have issues, just uninstall and reinstall from Nook Store/Cloud vs. Google Play Store and you'll be fine.)All of the other Android apps from Google Play that I tried have worked fine.  Pandora, Stitcher Internet Radio, Maps, Amazon MP3, Amazon Kindle (wow! a bit of a surprise!), Gmail, YouTube, etc. all work as expected.  The new openness of the NOOK HD+ is a game changer for the NOOK line, and pushes it way up in the rankings in my opinion.I bought mine at the local B&N; store and there's a lot of help available there if you need it, which is a huge bonus if you are tech challenged and need advice and help locally.  Very friendly staff and great customer service, what a novel concept!  ;)The Nook HD+ is a \"sleeper\" - an often overlooked alternative to other more expensive tablets that can both out perform them and well beat them in value, being available currently at very attractive prices.

I realize for those that have come from old hardware or new to tablets might believe this is a bit harsh, but keep in mind this is more of a comparison to other options available out there. Granted there are price differences and for price alone, this is a decent deal.The hardware itself is impressive. Bought these for our 4 and 6 years which were upgrading from their Galaxy 2 7\" tablets. The most significant issue with these tablets is the B&N; version of an already outdated Android OS_Ice Cream Sandwich, not the latest Jelly Bean which is far far better. It is very clunky and very slow, not at all snappy by any sense, even with the latest updates. I did buy it as they finally put Play on it which was a requirement for me, but the OS itself is just horrible. It does have a kids profile mods which is very handy as it allows you to limit what your kids can open.Additionally, as this is an 'overlay' OS, it is very limited in terms of options. Sound options are none existent for various task such as switching profiles, etc. Many apps on the Google store will indicate not compatible with this device. I generally ROM my Android devices however CM10 is the only one at this time with any support and that ROM is very very buggy compared to say Frosty ROM which is not available for this tablet. It works, but again, not a smooth integration of a ROM. So really, your stuck with what B&N; puts on it and at this time, it is very slow and clunky. Now you can 'BUY' a card with Jelly Bean on it, but again, pulling off the card is slower vs. internal memory, though it does allow for a very simple method of getting a 'real' Android OS on this tablet and perhaps the best route at this time.For the kids, they still like the tablet, enjoy the better graphics, larger screen, etc. Once going graphics is good, sound is adequate though not great, touch input is good. But for me, I could never use this tablet for serious use. My Asus TF700T is my go to tablet, even over my iPad 4,3,2,etc. At this time I am contemplating just selling these and buy Nexus tablets for the kids instead as it is more a pure Android experience and not hindered by the clunky implementation of an older Android OS. Perhaps if B&N; releases an OS based on Jelly Bean it may improve things.Bottom line, there are far better options in the Android world.PROSGood resolutionTouch is goodGreat balance of size, not large nor small like a 7\" tabletHas Play installedExternal memory card optionCONSB&N; OS is horrible, slow, cluncky, and based on old Ice Cream Sandwich, not Jelly BeanSpeakers are just OKVery limited accessory options compared to even Kindle HD devicesCharger plug is very tight on both of my models.

Make sure to note the orientation of the HD as it will only work one way...easy to put the replacement HD in \"backwards\".  Replace with the new HD.  The only trouble I had was the cable would not stay in the HD for some reason.  I had to use a piece of tape to secure the cable to the HD so it wouldn't come out.  Next, using a small pair of needle-nose pliers, grip the small ribbon cable gently, and push it back into it's slot.  Finally, carefully hold the HD in place and re-attach the two ipod pieces.Now you will have to restore to factory settings.

Melillo \"gloriana\"", "helpful": [15, 26], "reviewText": "This film is definitely not for anyone who is especially fond of the independent, delightfully manipulative and clever boy who was the brain child of Samuel Clemens's classic.As one example, the book has great  fun with the scenes involving Aunt Polly, a simple minded soul who thinks  herself quite clever, and the genuinely shrewd Tom, who plays on catering  to Polly's illusions about her own wit. This is a far cry from beautiful,  intelligent Celeste Holm's portrayal of Polly - and the family's poverty,  clearly seen in the book, disappears, as the Sawyers occupy a beautiful  home and are close friends with wealthy Widow Douglas.Some of the plot  is distorted in ways that remove the charm of the original. Tom's taking  off to &quot;play pirates&quot; after Becky jilts him is changed into a  troubled kid's escape after Aunt Polly tells him how &quot;no good&quot;  his father was - the humour, and the engaging portrayal of adolescent  &quot;first love&quot; is gone. The theme of Tom's learning responsibility  is overworked, and sequences that are hilarious in the book (Sunday school,  classroom, etc) are largely left out. The enchanting Becky Thatcher is  reduced to a tomboy. And isn't much of the picnic sequence ruined when a  gathering of kids is changed to a song-and-dance outing for families? (Tom  Sawyer is quite realistic in its setting forth that kids are far more  concerned with themselves than fretting about parents - let's not turn it  into a commentary on &quot;family values&quot; a la 1990s political  correctness.)Johnny Whitaker's singing voice has all the appeal of  chalk squeaking on a blackboard.

After all, it had music by the Sherman Brothers (best known for their work in Mary Poppins).  And I love a good musical.The book stays very true to the novel.  Tom Sawyer (Johnny Whitaker) is a young boy growing up in 1840's Hannibal, Missouri.  An orphan, he's being raised by his Aunt Polly (Celeste Holm).  And he is quite the handful.  He regularly plays hooky to fish and swim with best pal Huckleberry Finn (Jeff East).  He constantly lies to get out of trouble, too.Through this movie, we watch as Tom struggles with his conscience after witnessing a murder in the cemetery.  He tricks the boys in town to white washing the fence for him.  And he develops a crush on new girl Becky Thatcher (a young Jodie Foster).  But will Injun Joe (Kunu Hank) get his sworn revenge on the boy?This movie is extremely faithful to the book, hitting all the highlights of the classic.  Frankly, that was a problem for me since it took a little while to get going.  Once I got into the story, I was hooked and really began to enjoy the tale.  The scenery and costumes recreate the times well.  And the acting was pretty good.Unfortunately, I found the songs disappointing.  They weren't bad, but they weren't good either.  They aren't especially memorable or singable, and they don't really advance the story.  I would rather rewatch this movie for the characters and adventures then the songs.Despite that rather major flaw for a musical, I must admit to enjoying it.  It has a sweetness and innocence that I enjoyed.  And the songs are easy to overlook since they aren't a major part of the movie.

Surprisingly, this case is better designed for a Nook for two reasons:>>The sleep/power button location. On the Nook, the button is on the top center so none of the four corner holds block any button or access port. However, on the Kindle the button - which requires a slide, not a press - is towards the left of the device top and is covered slightly by the top left corner hold. This isn't a deal breaker for me, but I was very surprised at it because its being marketed for the Kindle! So when I want to wake up my Kindle I have to move the corner hold, slide the switch, and then readjust the corner hold. Not easy to do because the hold has a lot of (good) tension.>>5 way directional key. The notebooks that are included with this case slide into the case from the top and still have room to move both left and right. Because of the lining of the case and the thin cover of the notebook, it slides easily but I've never had it come out. I have however had it slide far right inside the cover, and then when I shut the cover it's at such a position that it hits the 5 way directional key and starts to advance chapters! I thought it was just a fluke at first, but then it kept happening. If I do not adjust the position of the notebook or force the Kindle into sleep then the notebook hits the key every time now. The Nook lacks this 5 way directional key entirely, so again - no issues there. (This issue might also be contributed to the \"breaking in\" of the case so that the spine is not rigid anymore and allows the front to move at angles. I don't believe I've been rough with the case though, so I can only assume its common wear).I also want to through my hat into the ring in regards to the less than compact design - though in truth I don't think it could have been any slimmer without causing negative pressure to the devices when closed.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Design works better with a Nook than a Kindle.", "unixReviewTime": 1284595200, "reviewTime": "09 16, 2010"}

Haggard", "helpful": [49, 53], "reviewText": "I'm starting my review over and changing this from 4 stars (I like it) to 2 stars (I don't like it).. At first I praised it highly based upon initial expectations., but now that I actually used it for work I'm seeing it may not be the case for me.I've tried a number of cases for the ipad from a travel case to the marware eco-vue to the otterbox. I always wanted one with a notepad built in and was excited to see the Moleskine iPad case. I placed my order on Nov. 7th and after nearly 3 weeks it finally arrived.Initial reactions, I like the case. It was thick and felt pretty solid. I liked the way the case held the iPad and overall the case seemed really well built. Now, I don't have ANY issues with the build quality. The case is built very well. And others have complained about the thickness, well I expected it to be a little thick since it now has a notebook with it. My measurement, it's just at the 1\" mark in terms of thickness.What did I like:-Construction quality, very nicely made.-iPad protection, the iPad is held very securely in the case, big plus.-Love that it has a notebook, unfortunately it's not a standard size which makes this a minus as well.-Looks professional. This is one of the best looking cases I have seen.My issue comes into the issues I found while using the case.First off, the volume and mute switch are on the inside of the case. This means you need to fold open the case if you need to mute or turn the sound down on your ipad. It's a minor inconvenience, but if I'm in a meeting and my calendar app starts shooting alerts it's nice to be able to flip the switch quickly then go through opening the notebook up and having to mute it. Now in most meetings I am actively taking notes but in other meetings I'm just a observer so when I am not taking notes this issue causes more of a distraction.Second, replacement notebooks. I have been searching high and low for replacement notebooks and cannot find any. I found some small jr. legal pads and tried those and yes they work, but they don't sit as securely in the sleeve like the moleskine brand pad is and I think this could cause to ripping or sagging of the fabric. I think you are going to need moleskine brand pads or risk ruining the fabric sleeve. This is just a guess. And since you can't at the current time buy replacement notebooks you are out of luck once you run through the initial 50 pages.Third, no pen loop. They give you a notebook and a spot for your iPad, but nowhere to hook a pen. Yes I can carry a pen in my pocket, but you would think for the cost there would be a small loop to hold a pen or iPad Stylus like the pogosketch.Fourth, the true left-handedness of the case. The case can in fact be used by left handed people, but that causes a few issues. First off the back becomes the cover and now you have an upside down moleskine logo, plus the band is attached to the back so the sleek look is gone. Then my biggest complaint, the iPad is upside down when used in left handed mode so the home button is at the top. This also means the microphone is opposite the home button. So when the home button is at the top the microphone is pointed towards you. I use an app to record audio from meetings and take notes and when the iPad is faced the right direction this works flawlessly. When I use the Moleskine case in left handed mode the microphone faces me and in turn the audio is hard to hear as it is pointed away from the conversations.Fifth, no stand. It would be nice if you could somehow stand the ipad up but this case is really just meant to be used flat on it's back. It's not sold as a case with a stand, but come on, for topping the $60 mark you would think it would have one.All in all, it's  nice to finally have a case, built well with a notepad. But given the lack of replacement notebooks readily for sale for this case and no pen loop to carry a writing instrument makes it weak. I can use the case in right handed mode, but they sell it as left handed compatible and it really isn't as functional as it should be. They instead should release a second model that IS built for left handed and not make one unit semi-reversible.I may end up returning this case and going back to my marware. I'm going to keep using it until the end of this week before deciding..--UPDATE 12/9/2010--I have returned the case back to Amazon and have gone back to theMarware Eco-Vue for iPad. This out of all the cases I have use is the best for my personal situation. I wanted to like the Moleskine case but it just didn't work for me and I still can't find replacement notepads. Sorry Moleskine, perhaps revision 2 will be the one for me, but so far your case didn't meet my expectations.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "It's an ok case, with some major flaws.", "unixReviewTime": 1291075200, "reviewTime": "11 30, 2010"}

THIS monitor displays at 60 hz (which is fantastic).  To clarify, essentially hz is pretty much how much fps a monitor can display per second.

Dancer", "helpful": [11, 13], "reviewText": "I purchased this player for my 9 year old daughters Acer Aspire One Netbook D255E for her to play DVDs, games and to load Norton 360 on the netbook.  Item arrived quickly in a box combined with other items from Amazon, simply wrapped in one layer of bubble wrap and put in the box.  There were no receipts etc for the shipment, and only a small booklet for installation on older Windows OS systems.  The booklet DID mention that the unit is a CD/DVD burner, but required additional software to do so (I checked on my Acer 5532 laptop after plugging it in and running a diagnostic check, it is only a DVD/CD player).  It also came with a USB driver disc which was unnecessary for my installation, and two USB plugs, one for media and one for power.  Simple to figure out though, just plug in both USB plugs and Windows 7 Starter did the rest.  However, like others with Windows 7 Starter, I had to download VLC Media Player to play DVD's.  No problem there, except for the additional junk that came with the Media player download which I immediately deleted. The CD/DVD player works great now, and sounds especially awesome on earbuds.  I have a Windows anytime upgrade from Starter to full home version ready to install, but I may return it now that I have this DVD/CD Rom working and the free desktop download correction fixed.Cons:  I was let down that so many others purchased the same unit and received a free upgrade to a DVD/CD burner.  That is not a real major setback since this is for a 9 yr olds netbook, but it would have been nice to have as a back up to our other burner.  One for all and all for one I say!Pros:  Easy,  I mean EASY setup.  Also found it nice that you do not need to utilize both USB cables, just plug in the media plug to the USB 2 and that is all required.  Great price considering the seller guaranteed it would work with my Acer One Netbook model.  Free shipping!!!!  Case seems to be sturdy enough, (just don't pick it up and turn it side to side while it is playing).  Region settings available, so it plays most everything.  GREAT DVD picture on both my Acer laptop and the Acer Aspire one netbook, very pleased!Overall,  I would recommend this to anyone needing a DVD/CD rom for the Acer Aspire One Netbook,  provided you do not want a unit for burning CD's and DVD's..UPDATE 01 March 2011:  The more I use this player the more I like it.  The picture on my daughters Acer Aspire one Netbook is sharper than the one on my Acer Laptop with widescreen HD. If you are an Acer Netbook lover, this is the external player for you.  Just a reminder, it is not a DVD/CD burner.Final Update 04-14-2011:  I finally upgraded my daughters Acer One Netbook from Windows starter to Windows 7 and the new OS picked up this player with no external help required for drivers etc.  I also upgraded to 2GB memory, (see my other reviews), which took all of about 4 minutes to accomplish!  My daughter is playing video games and watching DVD movies off this little player like there is no tomorrow!!  I am amazed that this player has performed as it has.  Total thumbs up for quality and performance!!!  I upgraded to 5 stars, simply based on the overall performance and lifespan thus far.

So far everything works as expected. I use them in a Fenix P3D Premium 100 (Luxeon Rebel LED, 11 - 200 lumens), and a Fenix P1 CE (Cree 7090 XR-E LED - 90 lumens). For me the performance is very acceptable considering how inexpensive the kit was. I get maybe an hour to 1-1/2 hours total runtime depending which brightness levels I'm using. I don't use the lights for more than 10 or 15 minutes at a time anyway so that's plenty of uses between charges for me.A nice plus is you get the car charger adapter included, too. Most kits require you to buy that separately at additional cost. Probably the only thing I would have liked with the kit is some kind of pouch to keep it all together. I made a carrying case out of an old zippered memory card/battery case I had hanging around. It just happens to all fit perfectly but it took an awful lot of finagling to make that happen!UPDATE 11-14-09I just wanted to update this review to say I am still using these cells and they are still working great. I think the runtime has improved after a few charge/recharge cycles (which is what is supposed to happen), so these are lasting even longer in my lights now. I only recharge them maybe every 4 months with occasional use of my lights. Still highly recommended.UPDATE 11-17-2010I guess it's time for my now yearly update on these batteries. They are still all going strong! I still only recharge them about every 4 months but that's because they have a very good charge retention and capacity.Another big surprise involving these batteries occurred over the summer (2010). I keep my Fenix P1 CE light on my keychain. To turn the light on and off you screw and unscrew the head slightly. If you unscrew it all the way the head comes off (that how you replace the battery). I guess the head had loosened in my pocket because one day as I was walking to my car I removed my car keys from my pocket. I stepped on something hard and happened to look down to see what it was. Well, it turned out to be one of these batteries! I had slightly deformed the top of the battery and ripped part of the plastic that makes up the case of the battery. I didn't have anything to lose so I trimmed off the plastic that was torn, and sealed the case up with some super glue. Fortunately, the battery still fit in the flashlight and it worked fine - still had a full charge! I've since charged it twice and it is still working great.

Stayed in over 22 hotels and on a train sleeper car and never had a problem.  I travel with a CPAP breathing machine and it was critical to have power every night so I could sleep.  I also had an iPhone and my brother had an iPad and the USB charger was great for both.  I could also use one plug to both power the CPAP and charge the iPhone.  It was really nice to have the red lights that indicated that you had power since many outlets in Europe and UK have some sort of switch that turns the power off to each individual outlet.  Also, on the train, the red light wast coming on and let me know that the outlet wasn't working.  I worked with the conductor to get some circuit breakers on the train reset by letting him know when the red light came back on.  That was quite a time saver and great tool for that purpose.The only negative I have is that the part that holds the US plug into the device could be a little more snug.  It felt like it was going to fall out at times (and did fallout 1-2 times but that wasn't much over 6 weeks of use).There is one design enhancement that I would have put into this device: When using the UK converter, they could have made the bottom of the device a 2nd 110 outlet so that you would have 2 110 outlets (the regular one on the back and one on the bottom using the Euro converter) as well as the USB outlet.

Always the same scenes, at the exact same time - so it wasn't a fit issue.  But the scenes played perfectly when I switched back to my old adapter and cable.  Also - I found I wasn't able to play big (20 gig+) 3D rips, when the other cable could.So . . . for most tablets and cameras this cable will work fine.  I suspect this cable will be fine for the Tegra 2 tablets (Original Transformer, Galaxy Tab, Acer Iconia, etc.) since playback is generally limited to 720P.

I record on them all the time and it's just so fng ridiculous that they could be discontinued, or be sold for fifty dollars. It's true, that no tape really sounds better than these, unless they were to start releasing metal tapes again, which is impossible in this market.I record lps onto these tapes, and listen to them in the car. It took me a long time to get the peaks right for recording, as in where I should average the peak decibels to record at. I eventually came to five plus, which means the bars never go above four decibels. I believe my peak levels are in line with the balance of sound, that while the directional booklet for my cassette player (a tck670 sony three-head) says record at plus three, letting it go a little bit above that but average at +3, means you're getting as much sound  without breaking your eardrums. They also say to record two decibels below the distortion point, and for me that's like 7+ on a lot of stuff[some records are louder or softer than others when it comes to decibels. For instance Prince sign O' the Times is very loud, and I record at around five+ or below, while the smiths queen is dead, the newly remastered version, is softer, and I record at a 7 recording level. Recording level is how much sound is filtered through the cassette player onto the recording medium, while the decibel count meter shows you how--scientifically that is--loud what you are recording really is].Now I'm not gonna' say it's always pretty, sometimes there's an album like let it bleed, where the lp was put together rather shoddily, and the acoustic tracks are subzero to the rockier tracks. In such cases I've tried to record each track at the peak individually, though I haven't really heard them enough yet to know if this works. I will say that listening to these on a car stereo, well, the car stereo is a lot more sensitive than floor-standers and a good sony receiver. You have to be accurate to get the best sounding tape, but the reward can be fantastic.You see, I used to listen to cds, like all through college, but then my ears started to turn negative to the extreme highs and mids. Plus, you never understand the music in your brain from a cd like you do on an lp. Basically I cannot barely stand to listen to digital unless I have extremely good speakers, and that's not often.So lps it is for me, but I wanted to hear them in my car, so began this whole trek to get the tapes to sound right. High bias is much more difficult to get right than normal bias, which if you listen through a good stereo, reveals all the definition of a rough sketch on paper. The high bias is pretty accurate, though someday I would wish to maybe improve the class of cassette player I have and see if I can't do even better? Oh well, right now I have a system and it works pretty well.And to think they're not putting cassette players into new cars anymore! I rather think the record industry would not be suffering now as it is, if it had kept true to fidelity and analogue, and most importantly vinyl, which cannot hardly be digitally downloaded without gutting the sound and a lot of work! It's what they get for years of $20 for new cds and the nightmare of sam goody. They wanted to profit by everyone buying their collections all over again, and look where it has got them! People listen to music--if at all--as a casual thing, where they never really listen and wouldn't spend a dime for the crap they do in fact hear. The labels killed their own business by choosing the cd over the lp.But at least I can find used lps for bargain prices now, eh?Or prohibitively expensive boxsets. ):", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "high bias tapes, who's got some more?", "unixReviewTime": 1328313600, "reviewTime": "02 4, 2012"}

As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record the sounds of record albums, radio shows, CD-Rs, people talking and more. These tapes have 90 minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are 45 blank minutes for recording on each side. Record lectures, music, conversations, piano playing and more--whatever you want! The tape playback will work well in any basic tape deck including the one in your car.The tapes are extremely well made in that they DO allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment because you can record over them many times; and they take up very little room so they're easy to carry around with you.If you pay the current Amazon price of $13.77 for the five-pack you spend roughly $2.75 per tape. Some people will find that to be too expensive while others will want these blank cassette tapes anyway, not minding having to pay the price.Unfortunately, these tapes still cannot produce 100% the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a CD-R onto another CD-R instead of a Maxell cassette tape, the quality of the sound on the CD-R copy would be at least somewhat sharper and clearer with less background noise than these Maxell cassette tapes will give you. Moreover, cassette tapes can break if not handled with care. They can also break if used a few too many times, too. Therefore, I recommend that any important recorded material should be copied onto another blank tape and then keep that second tape in a safe place to use as a backup. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow top of each cassette which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible. If you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole. The cassette tape is now ready to record a fresh recording. I also agree with the gentleman who suggests that you clean the heads of the tape deck before using these cassette tapes to maximize the quality of the recording.Overall, Maxell Xlii high bias cassette tapes makes a great choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music, the radio, people talking or anything you wish to record.

I've used them on a Nakamichi 581 cassette deck, a Tandberg TCD320 cassette deck, and small hand-held recorders from Sony (with built-in microphone).I've used the Maxell XLII tapes for recording albums from vinyl, recording from compact discs, and recording live, e.g., parties, waterfalls, and my own electric-guitar playing using a Nakamichi microphone.When I first got my Nakamichi 581, I did a side-by-side test of an actual vinyl record, and my taped copy of the vinyl recording.  I was not able to tell the difference.  This demonstrates the high quality of the Maxell XLII tape.  The particular recording was a duet with Max Roach on drums and Anthony Braxton on saxophone.  This recording was an especial challenge to the tape's ability to record at higher frequencies.  The Maxell tape passed the test, so to speak.  Also, I recently listened to recordings that I made in the year 1980.  I have no reason to believe that the recordings on my Maxell tape have deteriorated.  This is another good thing about the Maxell XLII tape.I have nothing bad to say about the 90 minute Maxell XLII tape.But I do have bad things to say about tape recorders.  First of all, my Tandberg is a risky machine.  Perhaps, one time out of 100 times that I use the Tandberg, the tape gets tangled up.  I blame this on the Tandberg, not on the tape.  Another problem is that my Nakamichi 581 has been broken for many years, and I have not been able to find anybody who repairs this sort of machine.  The Nakamichi 581 was, and probably still is, the highest quality cassette deck known to mankind.  But I can't find anybody who can fix mine.  Again, this is not the fault of the tape.Finally, Sony had an excellent little hand-held cassette player/recorder, the TCM-454VK.  The sound quality of this machine is fine for recording nature sounds and children's music concerts.  However, I dropped this Sony machine, and it broke, and it is not manufactured anymore.  Instead, Sony does make a similar, newer model, but the sound quality of this Sony cassette recorder is garbage (please see my reviews of the newer Sony machine).  But this is not the fault of the tape. Sony TCM-200DV Standard Cassette Voice Recorder adds a high-pitched whining sound to your tapes.  A similar recorder, the Panasonic RQ-L31 Portable Cassette Recorder with Slide Microphone, adds a high-pitched chirping sound to your tapes.The following applies only to recording nature sounds, children's marching bands, and so on.  The following does not apply to making tape recordings from commercially available music on compact discs.Last year, I bought a digital voice recorder, the Olympus DS-40.  Please see my review of the Olympus DS-40.  The Olympus DS-40 is an absolute dream and a miracle  -- because of the very low background noise, because of the absence of clicking sounds when starting/stopping or when pausing/restarting recordings, because of the extreme length of recordability, and because of its extremely compact size.  Therefore, at least for amateur recordings of nature sounds, marching bands, and parties, cassette tapes and cassette recorders might no longer be medium of choice.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "These tapes have been my friend from 1980 to 2009.", "unixReviewTime": 1263254400, "reviewTime": "01 12, 2010"}

These things don't do much; you stick it in, listen to some jingoism and a pleasing voice on the first track, then advance to the cleaning track and wait for 20 seconds while a continuous beep ensures you turn the volume way down. Afterward, your lens is clean. That's all there is to it.Why does the lens have to be cleaned? I can't answer that since I've never seen one. In the cassette era, I bought a clumsy plug-in electrical wand with a metal probe that I had to physically touch to my recording and playback heads (on reel-to-reel players too) to demagnitize them. Apparently all that tape going through left some kind of magnetic charge behind that would foul the signal at some point. It's questionable whether the gadget I owned ever actually worked, unlike this product, which works every time.There's no such issue with the digital CD lens cleaner. This disk has some encoded voice commands and about a dozen little brushes the protrude about 1/8 of an inch from the surface of the disk. I guess the disk spins and the brushes rub off the bad stuff from the CD lens. If there's another explanation, I'd like to hear it. It works every time.Unfortunately, the thing this product won't do is eliminate age from cranky car CD players. I've owned a couple GM models where the player had to be replaced and the player in my 2006 Chevy Malibu is becoming increasingly wearisome. It has a habit of failing to play disks that are thicker than the norm. You'd think there would be a standard in the digital industry but there is not. Sometime spinning my maxell CD-340 arrests this behavior but typically it does not. I usually have to burn myself a homemade disk on a maxell CD-R blank disk Maxell 32x CD-R For Music - 30 Spindle to get the recalcitrant player to spin the music.As for the cleaner, it works in spades every time.

For basic computer usage and pop music, these sound perfectly fine.Comfort: Actually, these are the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. I get headaches if I wear a pair of headphones for too long, due to the pressure on my head. I also can't wear headbands for the same reason. These headphones are so lightweight and flexible that I can barely tell I'm wearing them - and so far, no headaches, even though I've worn them for some longer periods than I normally wear headphones.Overall, I'd say I'm surprisingly impressed with these headphones. I got them expecting the usual cheap headphones I buy (the brand changes, since I just buy the cheapest 'phones I can find by a brand I've actually heard of) and was pleasantly surprised by the comfort and quality of these headphones. I haven't had them for long, so I can't speak to the endurance of them, but even if they only last a short bit, I think I'd actually just replace them with these same ones. They're really that comfortable.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Cheap Headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1382832000, "reviewTime": "10 27, 2013"}

It's now January 2005 and the radio is still on the first set of batteries. I use it at least a 1/2 hour a day and on weekends as much as 3-4 hours per day. Fantastic. It shows no sign of wear even though it has spent hundreds of hours in the shower, and has even been in light rain beside our spa.It gets great reception (no TV signals in our town), is easy to use, and sounds great.I highly recommend this radio.UPDATE Oct 28, 2010After 7 1/2 years of daily use my Sony shower radio finally quit. As many others have reported the plastic on the top cracked, water got into the Off button area and the radio would no longer work. However I just ordered another one.This radio has some very good qualities.Pros:1) Clear and loud sound2) Battery life is so long it is ridiculous. I don't think I used more than three sets of batteries in 7 years, and I use the radio every day.3) Good reception.4) Ease of use. I really appreciate an AM/FM radio with station presets.5) It is waterproof enough that I take it in the shower every day. I don't leave it there though because I use it on the bathroom counter while I shave too. Perhaps mine lasted longer than many others because it isn't in the damp shower area 24/7.6) I like the top buttons. They are easy to hit with one hand. If the buttons were on the side or front it might require two hands. My radio is never mounted high so I don't have the issue others complain about where they can't see the buttons. Even if I did have it high it is easy to feel where the buttons are as they all have a raised bump.Cons:1) $49 is a very high price to pay for an AM/FM radio.2) It does seem Sony could do some research and improve the plastic top so it would last longer.I was pleased to see this radio is still available for sale.

I have 2 because one sits on bathroom sink and goes back & forth from bedroom to bathroom while getting dressed.  The other goes between kitchen and office constantly.  There's 5 presets for AM.  I wish there were more.  There's 10 presets for FM.  One used to be for Howard until he left (a huge Howard fan here who has not gone Sirius) and now I basically only use one for WCBS-FM (when they got smart and realized, in the immortal words of NY Daily News, that they didn't know jack), and the others go unused.  The TV channel part of this radio, I never use and couldn't comment.The radio is excellent.  The controls are responsive, the battery life is very decent, and most importantly, the reception is excellent.The reason my radios now need to be replaced (I just ordered one from Amazon and will try the Sangean for the second) is that the top of the radio is covered in plastic.  After 7 years of pressing the on/off button I'm sure thousands of times, the plastic over the on/off button ate through.  The on/off button needs that plastic over it to work!!  The damn thing won't turn on/off now!!

It still works fine, although the material covering the on/off button has worn completely off. Actually, it started wearing off after less than a year. In light of the fact that this is designed to be a \"shower radio,\" this is really an inexcusable flaw: after all, you cannot use the radio in the shower if water will seep into the innards of radio. Fortunately, I never used the radio in the shower itself. But, still, I'd have to take at least one star, even two stars off, for this defect (which I know other reviewers have commented on as well).The radio was a little smaller than I expected, but that's good. It takes up very little room on my bathroom counter and is quite unobtrusive. The reception is generally very good, although I tend to listen to only one station (89.3 KPCC). Still, I had trouble getting good reception with my last radio (an Aiwa), so the Sony is a big improvement. Occassionally, I still get a little static (depending on where I am standing in relation to the radio), but overall I would give it a score of 4.5/5.0 in terms of reception (I still occassionally get some static). I also tested all of the TV stations, and the Sony had no problem tuning them all in. No static to speak of, although the volume was low. I would definitely recommend this radio.The sound quality is quite good for a radio as small as this.

Basically, in a quiet environment these sound pretty good.  They aren't as good as similarly-priced studio-class headsets, but you're paying for the noise cancelling.  The raw capability is pretty decent, and has acceptable detail in treble, vocal, and bass ranges.The noise cancelling works pretty well.  I've taken these on several intercontinental flights and they do a decent job of blocking out engine rumble and screaming kids.  They also do a decent job of blocking out adult human voices, which is nice in the office.However, I must have pretty big ears, and I've found that the foam cups aren't quite thick enough to adequately push the driver away from my outer ear.  After 2 or 3 hours of use my ears start to ache a bit.The cord is plenty long, and can be disconnected in the middle to link to an optional Sony wired remote control.  An adapter to convert the standard 1/8th inch stereo jack to the dual 1/8th inch jacks in many airplane seats is included.The thing that I don't like about this is that I find these uncomfortable when I try to lean my head against the window in an airplane and sleep.  I think that the MDR-NC11's might have been a better choice in that regard.They're also kind of bulky unless you have a large carry-on to keep them in.  I'm paranoid about putting these in the seat pocket in front of me, since the MDR-NC20's come with a soft bag instead of a rigid clamshell like the Bose headsets.  I haven't had any spills yet, but active travellers may wish to find a case that's more rigid.All in all, I'm pretty happy with these.

If you're not listening to music and just compare the difference between having noise cancellation on and off, it's just not that great - partly because of the technology and partly because of the fit.  To quantify this, the noise canceling Sony headphones give 10dB of noise reduction whereas the passive David Clark H10-00 headphones for roughly the same price give 24dB just because of the better seal.

I used to fly two round trips a week, and I wore these constantly, whether or not there was any reason to (in flight entertainment, a CD player).The first benefit is that the noise reduction made speech more audible. I could hear the person in the next seat better, and, in fact, I found that I could eavesdrop on people a row or two away, since the noise that would normally have masked their conversation was masked, but the speech came through.The loud, constant background sound in airplanes is very draining. I was more likely to be able to nap with these on, and I was more likely to be able to concentrate on reading with less background noise.Don't get a unit that simply insulates the sound - you might as well use earplugs or sealing earbuds. There is nothing wrong with that solution, it is just that the solution of generated countersound (exactly out of phase, exactly the right amount and frequency for the sound that is incoming), especially when the countersound is based on microphones that are right at the earphones - as far as I am concerned, nothing works as well.Microphones that are placed in an off-headphone device can't tell where the headphones are direction, or what in the environment might be changing the sound at the headphones. This effect is not as important at low frequencies, but it becomes more important at higher frequencies, so this unit can provide more coverage. The design is simply the best possible - microphones as close to the ear as possible is a huge design benefit.Well, being in a quiet environment works better, but that is not always available.When you are flying, especially if you fly a lot, small incremental increases in comfort really are worth it. These cost me less than a quarter per flight, have lasted years and are still going strong.Sound quality was fine.

The Palm didn't fall far -- 3 feet or so -- but it is now useless. White lines cover the display, and the digitizer no  longer works reliably. I have tried opening up the case and re-seating the  circuit boards, which fixed most of the problems, but the digitizer is  permanently inaccurate. Even with re-calibration of the digitizer using  preferences, the location the Palm thinks I'm hitting with the stylus is  wrong, and this makes using the Palm impossible.I bought the slimline  leather case, but this clearly failed to protect the Palm in any way. Also,  the velcro has now come unstuck, so my Palm won't stay in the case.This  is a real shame, as my Palm IIIx is indispensable. I bought Intellisync  software to syncrhonize it to the calendaring software I have on my PC, and  I use it every day to navigate my schedule. Combined with the address book  for names and phone numbers, I have one place to work out what I'm supposed  to be doing and whom I'm doing it with.I don't use the other  applications much. I tried out the e-mail application, but it is way too  simplistic. I get over 200 e-mails a day, and I really need e-mail folders  with automatic filtering to manage that kind of volume. I use Eudora, and  the Palm e-mail application doesn't support its folders or filtering. I  can't even convince it to just download the messages left in my  &quot;in&quot; box after all the others have been filtered out.Being  able to upgrade the operating system on the IIIx turned out to be  important. Version 3.3 of PalmOS supports infra-red sync with a laptop.  This is a godsend when I'm travelling, and for syncing during long  meetings. Being able to upgrade easily from PalmOS 3.1 made it  possible.I have also downloaded a few games to while away long plane  trips -- PocketChess is my favourite. Very easy to play -- just drag 'n'  drop the pieces.I have looked at the Handspring Visor as a replacement,  but lack of upgradeabile OS is a key sticking point. Handspring devices are  stuck at Palm OS 3.1, and Handspring's code seems to have diverged at this  point with no hope of picking up any changes post-version 3.1. Long term,  this could turn into a real problem assuming Palm continues to improve  PalmOS. The Springboard expansion slot is a great idea, but there are so  few expansion cards available that its utility is a joke. Color cases  looked cool -- until I saw them in real life vs. a photo on the web. They  look kinda cheap &amp; nasty.So, I'll probably buy another Palm IIIx.  The IIIe isn't expandable, and I can't see how color is so useful that it  justifies the staggering price of the IIIc. The Palm V looks cool but I'm  even more worried about its fragility, and the Palm VII could be great if  it could actually surf the web, rather than use extraordinarily limited  &quot;web clippings&quot;.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great product, but fragile", "unixReviewTime": 957484800, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2000"}

I'll assume you are reading these reviews because you already know that the Palm OS beats CE any day. So the choice is a Palm Vx, a Palm V, a IIIx or a Visor. I can't recommend the Visor right now due to the horrible problems people are  having with Handspring...maybe in another year, but not now.The new Vx  is a good choice, lots of memory and the other advantages of the Palm V  like a better screen, and rechargeable battery. But the darn thing is still  overpriced. If money is no problem though, I'd probably go with the Vx.The V is good too, but only 2 meg of memory...yuck! Now, 2 meg of memory  is going to be enough for a lot of people. If all you want to do is the  basic appointment/phone book/to-do stuff, 2 meg is more than you'll ever  need. But that's it...you're stuck with 2 meg and can't upgrade (easily).  If you are interested in using your Palm to do internet stuff, grab  webpages with AvantGo, play games, read books, etc. you're going to find  yourself a bit squeezed by 2 meg.

It worked great (for about 3 months).  It played all the DVDs and CDs.  Unfortunately, it cannot read VCDs or CD-R/RWs.  For most people that doesn't matter, I guess.  However, only after about 3 months of light usage, the player started to act-up.  Sometimes, it won't read the DVDs--the player indicated &quot;no disc&quot; in player.  I unplugged it and it worked after re-plugging it 1 minute later.  Then, it doesn't work again, and I repeated the same procedure of unplugging.  Finally, I sent the player back to RCA.  Since it was still under warranty, all I had to do was pay for shipping.  It came back after about a month.  It worked, and then I started to see the problem again within a couple of days. I was confused.  Why does it work sometimes but sometimes it fails to work?  So, I tested it out to see the prob. myself.  It appeared that the disc tray motor sounded weak, and being unable to read the disc, I thought, could be due to the fact that RCA had provided a weak motor part.  I was half right.  I removed the plug from the UPS/power supply and plugged it directly into the wall.  Ever since, the player was plugged directly into the wall, it shows no problem.  I think I may have found a solution (for now)--the difficulty in reading the disc, I concluded, was due to lack of power [believe it or not].  Well, if you have the same problem, try unplugging it and have a dedicated power supply for this player. It might work.Beside this, the machine is good.  It played every single DVDs I've ever rented or bought. I have this hooked up to my reciever through TosLink (optical cable).  The sound is excellent--good proportion of sound from center, satellite, rear and subwoofer.  It plays CD but it takes a second or 2 to skip to songs.

Once loaded with \"D\" batteries, it can be used to tone those upper arms during long listening sessions. Quality control seems to vary from set to set, but a few things off the bat that I found were awry for my $50 were:1) Build quality. The switches and dials seemed on the flimsy side, with the chrome finish easy to rub off.2) Dial Markings. For claiming to be a \"DX Machine\", both AM and FM fequency marks are more for wishful thinking than accuracy. Best bet is to find your local stations and re-mark the dial with whiteout or tape and the actual frequency re-written by hand.3) Audio. For using a large woofer,tweeter, and separate bass and treble controls, the audio quality could be better than it is. It still sounds good, but should be better.On the plus side:1) AM reception is fantastic. By turning the radio to null signals, I was able to pick up a small local on 1040 AM near Rochester, NY, then turn it again to cleanly pick up another station on 1040 AM in Salt Lake City.

They're designed to impress you in the big box store, where looks and the sound of the most powerful station in town are all you have to go on.  It isn't until you get them home that you find out how miserable they are in real-world performance, trying to pick up that weak station that's the only one carrying the game you want to hear.The GE Superadio is a whole 'nother deal.It's just an AM-FM radio, aggressively avoiding any other features whatsoever.  But it's the gold standard of the type.  When a radio geek wants to say whether some other set is good on FM and, especially, AM, s/he will compare it to the Superadio.To give you an idea how good it is; I live in a semi-remote area without any really strong AM stations.  Sitting side by side on my couch, a typical 'personal stereo' type radio picks up one AM station.  A cheap transistor radio picks up three.  The Superadio picks up 37.I recommend my friends get these as part of their blackout kits.  For one thing, it will run about two hours less than forever on its six D-cells.  For another, this set can pull in AM stations at least two, three hundred miles away, in daylight, any time.  If your blackout extends farther than this radio's range, you've got more important things to worry about.Incidently, it runs off AC also.  It switches to AC automatically when you plug it in, switches back to batteries automatically if AC isn't available.Sound quality is excellent.  It's mono, but it has a good and large speaker and enough audio power to drive it properly.  It also has separate treble and bass controls.I give it four stars instead of five for three reasons:1.  Some of them don't work.  The first one I bought didn't.2.  Stations are hard for me to tune toward the upper end of the AM band.  They're packed very tightly together there, and getting from one to another nearby is fiddly.3.  The \"wide\" bandwidth is useless to me.  There is no radio signal in my area strong enough for it.

I also wanted something battery-powered for emergency purposes in case of power failures/earthquakes, etc.First impression is that this is one big, ugly, heavy radio. That impression never goes away, because it is big, ugly, and heavy. The apparent workmanship, fit and finish, looks like it was put together in the dark,  by a developmentally-challeneged monkey, who had lost the instructions. It just looks, frankly, awful. Cheap plastic, poorly made (with all sorts of \"color swirls\"), with chrome paint. About like the interior of a mid-70's Chevy.It uses no fewer than 6 \"D\" cells. But the radio is so big you hardly notice. Most of the size comes from the 6\" diameter of the speaker and the enclosure behind it. It probably to about half a barrel of oil to make all the plastic. There's also a very crude perforated metal grate over the speakers. All the knobs and switch *seem* like they will fall of at any moment, and the tuning dial and linear indicator are similarly questionable. It has a handle, and while you can carry it around, it's a \"portable\" radio in the same sense that the original \"beige toaster\" 128k Macintosh was portable.As far as entertainment products go, this radio is the opposite end of the spectrum from the iPod \"Nano\".You might think that you will get some pretty great sound from a 6\" \"woofer\" and a about a 3/4\" \"tweeter. But no - the sound quality, overall, it not very good at all. It always sounds \"tinny\" and while it's plenty good enough for AM voice it's really not much better on FM.But, by golly, it does have absolutely terrific AM reception. Right away, all the\"problem\" stations I had before were perfectly clear. With a Terk loop antenna, I spent a few late nights trying to see how many of the 50kW \"clear channel\" stations I could get. With care in tuning the antenna and the radio, I got the Hartford, CT, station on the first try. Didn't last too long, but I got it. This from *Sunnyvale, California*. It's relatively easy to get stations in Wyoming and Nebraska on good nights. Seattle, LA, Salt Lake, no problem anytime, even with the internal antenna.The tuning indicator is nowhere close to accurate and in any case the markings are so crude that you can't reliably set the radio using the existing marks. I just put some paper correction tape on the scale and marked the frequencies with a pencil.One thing that I didn't see in the other reviews, or anywhere else except the instructions, is that the radio is capable of being set to use 20 kHz bandwidth instead of the usual 10, meaning you get a lot better sound than normal. The speakers stink, but the reception is better and the incoming information is less compressed. Of course you want narrow for long-distance listening but if you listen to nearby stations it helps quite a bit.The FM performance is nothing to write home about, hardly any different from any other radio you might buy. It has AFC to help control the drift, and it seems to work just fine. But it's a mono radio, and the speaker quality limits the sound quality. It's bad enough that it will wear you out if you listen to music for long. There are tone controls, but no amount of fiddling with the bass and treble will fix it. If you want a good-sounding FM Radio, get the Tivoli Model One. It's about 3x the price but the sound is about 10x better. It's clear to me that virtually all the price of the GE went into the AM receiver part, and the rest of it was compromised to meet the *very low* price.With the huge battery pack, I suspect it will run a very, very long time on one set. Of course, it can also use AC.Crudity aside, the radio works exactly as advertised, has brilliant AM reception, will probably run forever on a set of batteries, and is so inexpensive for the performance that you really can't go too wrong.p.s.  to clarify, my review is for the *GE* version, not the RCA version, which is still big, ugly, and poorly made - and also has terrible performance.

I should point out that this was in the evening, when radio signals travel best.One station that has always been problematic for me (KBAQ 89.5 FM transmitting from the other side of Phoenix) came in loud and almost perfectly clear. Unfortunately, selectivity on this radio's FM band is poor (GE chose fidelity over selectivity in this case), so 90.5 FM in Tucson is completely drowned out by 90.3 FM here in Phoenix. After opening the unit and replacing the stock IF filter with a 150 kHz filter (please read the Superadio FAQ on the Internet for more information), I can now pull in 90.5 as well.Thankfully, the radio has a narrow/wide band switch that lets you choose selectivity on the AM band: \"narrow\" for pulling in those hard-to-tune stations, and \"wide\" for getting extra fidelity from closer stations.At $40, it's hard to go wrong with this radio. The next step up would be a shortwave radio like the Grundig S350 ($100) or the Sangean CCRadio Plus ($150).UPDATE: I have only 2 complaints about this radio:1. Moving the volume control has a big effect on volume at low volume, but a small effect at high volume.2. Because this radio doesn't have a digital PLL tuner, it can be difficult to find a specific station when it also picks up so many other stations on the same part of the dial that you weren't looking for.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great reception for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1107475200, "reviewTime": "02 4, 2005"}

You could easily spend 2 or 3 times as much to get a radio that doesn't approach this performance.Not-so-strong points:1)  It's a big radio.  It won't fit in your pocket or briefcase, but it's no boombox either.2)  The analog tuning dial is not very accurate (as noted by many others.)3)  Build quality is about middle of the road.

So I was prepared for some rickety thing that had parts ready to fall off when you touched it, and a viewfinder that was as accurate as throwing a baseball at the tuner knob.  But the promise of awesome reception was all I needed to hear.First off, I work in a building which has a lot of electrical interference.  I needed something to get past that.  That was my only concern.  So it didn't much matter, as long as I could get past the interference.  Now that you know that, let me tell you about this thing.First of all it's not HUGE.  I'm 40 right now, so I've seen rickety bulky radio's that would kill if it hit you.  This is a nice unit, well sized for the speakers and antenna's in it.Second, it's very well built.  I tried to pull off the tuner knob to no effect.  Even the volume, treble and Bass buttons nicely placed on the unit can't be removed without some extra tool.  The switches are only two function switches, and are well built.  Granted it doesn't light up, and the tuner bar isn't a lit bar, but who cares, it's very well built.  I tried to squeeze the unit to see if I could make it crack, no, it's sturdy.Now, for the TUNING ability.  There is a WIDE and NARROW switch, which can either give you a very narrow tuning area, or a much WIDER tuning area.  A station I listen to at 740am appears on the WIDE area from 700 to about 750 on the dial.  However on the NARROW switch, it only comes in within a few millimeters of where 740 is.  That explains why people say the tuning was so bad, they had it set to wide.So all things said and done, how did it do against the interference?  Now basically I'm stuck in an area which is nothing short of several high tower power poles.  The improvement was marginal.  BUT to my surprise there are additional AM/FM jacks on the back that you can add an additional antenna or signal amplifiers to &lt;G>  I grabbed a power cord, wrapped it around the AM port, and between the improvement in tuning, signal grabbing, and the extra antennae, I'm getting very decent reception with only a small bit of hissing.This is a very nice radio, well worth every penny I spent on it.

It is simple to use with a large internal ferrite antenna. I have never connected it to an external antenna (screws for this are on the back) or antenna tuner, which I imagine would improve reception. Most new radios have digital synthesized tuners and while that adds tuning accuracy, it often adds noise that is bad for DXing. This radio is not the best built and has known quality control issues such as tuning inaccuracies that can be rectified. It isn't tiring to listen to because it has good sound quality due to the large main speaker, tweeter and bass/treble controls. The FM section works very well too.

These are the best radios on the market for fans of talk, sports, Art Bell, Phil Hendrie, etc. Which one should you buy? I have both (the GE for my office, ccradio for home) so here is my take on the two. Both have nearly equal AM reception. At night, you can easily pull in stations from hundreds of miles away (some say even over a thousand miles away but this depends on where you live). There the difference ends. The ccradio has a lot of features that I felt I wanted in a radio. It has a sleep timer, accurate digital tuning, automatic timer that turns your favorite show on at a predetermined time, scan buttons, lighted dial, power cord (not bulky adaptor), weather radio (with auto alert), memory buttons, tv audio of the network stations. The only flaw is that it has a grab indentation rather than a full handle. They are a family business and take GOOD care of their customers. The ccradio company LOVES radio and loves people who share their passion. Is it worth the [$$] for the extras? To me it is. The Ge Superadio has a rotary - and inaccurate - tuning dial. This will drive you crazy if you do a lot of channel switching. Some people tape graph paper to the radio and mark where they found the stations - it is that inaccurate. There is no timer, no alarm, no weather, no tv audio, no lit dial, etc. The sound is better on the GE Superadio, though. The GE SUperadio feels cheaply made and probably won't make it through many beach or camping excursions. The GE Superadio is enormously sized - it is the size of a small attache case or TV! If you only want to pull in one distant station and keep your dial set to that station, get the GE radio. That is all you need. It has great, almost legendary, reception without any bells or whistles. On the other hand, if you love radio, need the extras, change stations a lot, want something sturdily built that will last a lifetime, want to explore the large number of AM stations that are out there, go out and order the ccradio with slightly better reception (see their website to order). I am a radio person rather than a tv person. I have radio playing all day (as some people have tv going on all day). I sleep to radio (and need that sleep timer). I would rather listen to a talk show than watch a sit com. I would rather listen to Coast to coast, Phil Hendrie, and Rush than watch another rerun of Frasier or Friends. If you are like me, do yourself a favor and invest in the ccradio. You won't regret it. P.S., the FM reception will be better than you are used to, also.Bottom line: The GE superadio is low cost with no extras and big and bulky. The CCradio plus is expensive, has every extra you could want (except a decent handle), more sensitive but does nto sound as good as the GE for music.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Astounding AM reception", "unixReviewTime": 1071446400, "reviewTime": "12 15, 2003"}

Corning Ware was introduced long before anyone even knew what a microwave oven was and it turned out to be the best cookware for the ubiquitous food zapper.Now, the GE 7-2887 Superadio III takes its place among such prescient products.  Your humble communications technician, seeking to hear another human voice  while on the job in a computer room, found the Superadio III remarkably  well suited to the computer room environment.I had previously brought a  Grundig Yacht Boy 400 and a Sony ICF-2010 to work to listen to an AM talk  radio station, only to find out that what makes them so good for world band  (shortwave) reception are the very things that meant disaster in the  computer room's EMI (electro-magnetic interference) rich atmosphere.  Being  digital receivers, their computer-like circuits eagerly plucked from the  air the squeals, drones and squawks of the network servers, PCs and PBX  system that occupy the room while adding their own synthesizer noise to the  weakened signal.  I pondered the possibilities for better reception.  I  could put the radio nearer an exterior wall, crank up the volume loud  enough to hear while seated at my desk, and be promptly thrown into the  parking lot, since others in the room don't really want to hear the same  station.  Through the interference on the Sony came a commercial for the  CCRadio by C. Crane, a tabletop receiver specially designed for long  distance reception of AM news and talk radio stations (Translation: The  speaker ain't so hot for music).  Pricey but perhaps worth it.I read a  few reviews of the CCRadio and another model kept popping up as the  undisputed CHAMP of Long Distance AM Radio Reception, the standard against  which other contenders are measured, the one, the only, ladies and  gentlemen, let's hear it for the GE 7-2887 Superadio III.  Wow, I thought,  how often I had seen them at WalMart and Kmart and how often I said to  myself, yeah, right, Superadio, ha ha.  Yet, here were some of the  toughest-to-please SOBs who ever twiddled a tuning knob using this radio as THE benchmark.  I was intrigued.A quick visit  to the usual suspects (Best Buy, WalMart, Kmart) proved fruitless  (&quot;Sorry, if it's not on the shelf, we're out. . .No, I don't know when  we'll have more&quot;).  In desperation, I came to Amazon.com, typed  &quot;superadio&quot; in the Search box and there it was in all its  &quot;usually ships in 24 hours&quot; glory, and for less than  the best street price.  2 UPS Second Day Air days later, it was waiting for  me at home.  I didn't unbox the radio until I was back at work the next  day.Even before digging into my Sausage McMuffin with Egg breakfast, I  unpacked the Superadio III, plugged it in and was, indeed, amazed.  The  interference no longer dominated the signal from Los Angeles radio station  KFI.  It was still there, but not as much as on the Sony and Grundig.  The  Superadio III's analog tuner is, by its nature, more immune to it.  Throwing the WIDE/NORMAL switch to the NORMAL position reduced much of the  interference.  Judicious tuning and adjustment of the separate bass and  treble controls brought forth the desired sound while further fading the  interference to a tolerable level.  Thanks to the 2-speaker sound system,  the Superadio III delivers more &quot;presence&quot;, allowing it to sound  louder even though the volume might be lower than on a radio with inferior  sound.At the minus end of the scale is the tuning scale itself.  The  aforementioned station at 640 kHz appears between the 650 and 700 markings  (675 kHz?).  If you do a lot of station hopping, keeping a station list  with each's position on the 1-to-10 &quot;log scale&quot; above the AM and  FM scales might be a good idea.  Made in China and imported by Thomson  Consumer Electronics, the Superadio III has a less-than-substantial feel to  its construction and controls.  Better-built radios DO come out of China  (can you say &quot;Grundig&quot;?) but they also cost accordingly.For  its price, the GE 7-2887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio does just what  you buy it for and will probably continue to do so for many years to come  as more and more computer room hermits discover its ability to bring the  outside world inside.

It sounds great, with surprisingly good bass.At 13\"x9\"x4\", it isn't small.  And it it isn't light either, with 6 D batteries in it.  But I'll bet this heft is what makes the bass sound so good.I bought it because I wanted a good, inexpensive, big, vertical-format portable radio (I'm tired of the huge footprint and squatting look of most boomboxes today).  I wish it had digital tuning, but it doesn't.  The analog dial might not be very accurate, but in my experience, analog tuning has *never* been accurate.  I've always had to tune by ear rather than eye.Features: Power switch (button) is separate from the volume control.  So you won't be wearing out the volume knob every time you turn it on.  Bass and Treble controls.  A mono headphone out (meant for stereo headphones -- you get the same signal in each ear).  Loud.  Easily fills a good-sized room with sound.  On AM, it has an optional \"wide\" mode which can give you really great sound on some AM stations, at the price of selectivity.  On FM it has optional automatic frequency control which grabs the nearest strong FM signal (you may wish to turn off AFC for weak FM signals near strong stations).  It has terminals for external FM and AM antennas.  It has a nice, 36\" long FM antenna, and a 20cm internal ferrite rod for AM.  It has a nice handle on top, the kind that bangs into the FM antenna if the antenna is extended, so be careful.  There's no light on the tuning dial.  Again, you must tune by ear.Heavy, however, doesn't necessarily mean hardy.  Everything is plastic on it except the antenna and the speaker grille.

The AM reception is fantastic, with a super-large internal AM antenna that can be supplemented with an external antennal for hard-core 'DXing.  FM reception is so good you don't need the AFC function, but is only in monaural.  Tuning does not drift away from the frequency like so many other tuners.  There is also ample room inside the radio to add subcarrier circuits if you are into that sort of thing.The six D-cell batteries last for several months and are a boon for snow storms, power outages, and to tune in far-off stations without electrical interference.  The power supply is well shielded from noisy power sources.The sound is very rich with a huge range of bass and treble, which is perfect for attenuating static and whine.  The speaker is enormous and the radio features a high-quality tweeter.  The sound quality both on AC and batteries is super-powerful.The volume and bass/treble knobs on the front are a little too small for outdoor gloved use but that's the only complaint I have.  The antenna is easily replaced if damaged.  It seems to be impervious to light rain and splashes but is not water-resistant.I have several of these radios and have given them as gifts.  There appears to be some variance in quality between units, such as the maximum volume you can drive the speakers without distortion, but that appears to be due to changing suppliers of the large speaker.  Some people are bothered by the frequency display not closely tracking the frequency you're tuning, but I don't think anyone really looks at analog frequency gauges anyway.This is an excellent radio and is great when it is on sale.  The regular price is excessive, though, even for this level of quality.**EDIT**  In 2010, this radio is now known as the RCA Superadio III.  Model numbers include RCA 7-2887 and RCA RP7887.

It's not a question whether or not something made in China it's a matter how good it made there.  This radio is obviously was made in garage in China.  Just tell me why, but why there's no light on tuning scale, how hard it was to put simple connection to simple bulb.  GE seems not to care about quality of their product at all.

The connection is fairly clean (free of static); and the transfer speed is nearly as fast as if I had accessed the phone jack directly.I've gotten very used to sitting in my favorite chair and surfing the net.

I can walk around the house and listen to either Howard or the Rolling Stones channel through out, using one boom box.There are a few things to keep in mind if you want to get full use of these.* A) * Set the volume going into the transmiter higher. 2) Low volume in will cause popping and fading. Very low volume in will for some reason cause the transmitter to shut down. 2) Higher volume in will allow you to lower the preamp volume on the speakers and play with less distortion and lower noise level. When you increase the volume on the speakers, you are amplifying the NOISE as well as the music. Makes sense, right?B) The power cord is also part of the antenna, so its location and position can be adjusted to improve reception. I used little plastic wire ties to afix the cord to speaker stands. The cord runs straight down like a verticle antenna.C) The speaker is still a radio reciever and subject to interferrence. You can adjust the frequency on the transmitter and on the recievers (speakers). Fine tune them for the best reception in your location. This may take a few adjustsments. Remember, cellphones, WIFI etc can all interfere!I tried plugging the transmitter into my stereo's headset jack, but it didn't work well, because the output was too low.

The GPS315 represents a big improvement with better, quicker satelite acquistion, a compass screen that is ingenious allowing the user  to use the sun or moon to  correct bearing. This way the user is not having  to pull out a compass to check bearing. Additional pluses are its small  size and light weight using only two AA batteries lasting up to 15 hours.  If weight is a concern, that is big. My previous unit used four and lasted  five hours. Problems: The manual is as sorry as it can get. It barely  covers TrackRoute, Track History, Backtrack, and Reverse Route. These are  major important features left to the user to figure out. I have yet to  figure them out consistently. With Track History there seems to be an  ability to set a scale, but what scale? Nothing tells me. Is it how often  it records a waypoint in history?I have emailed the company with  questions twice, called once (had to leave a voice mail because they were  not taking calls), faxed once. Heard nothing from their customer  no-service. I wrote them yesterday to give them my thoughts. Oh yes, my GPS  315 crashed and had to be replaced last week after it was three weeks old.

Sherwin", "helpful": [6, 6], "reviewText": "Maxell manufactures excellent 90 minute cassette tapes for all purpose general recording. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record the sounds of record albums, radio shows, CD-Rs, people talking and more. These tapes have 90 minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are 45 blank minutes for recording on each side. The features of this tape, as one reviewer correctly notes, make it good for recording lectures and music using standard, less expensive home stereo equipment. The tape playback will work well in any basic tape deck including the one in your car.If you pay the Amazon price of $6.75 for the fifteen-pack you spend roughly 45 cents per tape and that's very inexpensive. The tapes allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment because you can record over them many times; and they take up very little room so they're easy to carry around with you.Unfortunately, these tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a CD-R onto another CD-R instead of a Maxell cassette tape, the quality of the sound on the CD-R copy would be sharper and clearer with less background noise than a Maxell cassette tape or any other brand of cassette tape could give you. Maxell also manufactures higher quality cassette tapes including the Maxell XL-II; but it's still not the same as a digitized CD-R recording. Moreover, cassette tapes can break if not handled with care. They can also break if used a few too many times, too. Therefore, I recommend that any important recorded material should be copied onto another blank tape and then keep that second tape in a safe place to use as a backup. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow top of each cassette which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible. If you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole. The cassette tape is now ready to record a fresh recording.Overall, Maxell makes a great choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music, the radio, people talking or anything you wish to record. I have used this brand for decades and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend Maxell normal bias 90 minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tape.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "fine normal bias 90 minute tape though it could stand a little improvement", "unixReviewTime": 1186272000, "reviewTime": "08 5, 2007"}

(Sony and TDK I have always found good too.) For those who don't know, the 160 minute uses thinner tape in order to get it on the same reel as a 120.  When tape is thinner there is more possibility for the layers to stick to each other by static electricity. Therefore I don't recommend 160 for repeated reusing but for some long thing, or somethings adding up to 8 hours (at SP) to save and watch sometime.  The 120s I use and reuse a lot, and keep a lot too.  :-)  Long may the VCR's survive.P.S.  oooops! Made an error above.  I said 8 hrs. at SP. Of course, we all know SP is the fastest.

I also tried the Sony RF950-RK, which is in a comparable price range.What I liked about Sony:  longer battery life (15 hr instead of 6 hr); there's a stand on which you can hang your headphones; there's an auto on-off feature that saves battery life.What I didn't like about Sony:  you have to take the batteries out and put them into a recharger unit (I was expecting to just hang the headphones on the stand and have them recharge, like the Palm Pilots do in their cradles); when I tilt my head forward (at my desk, since I use these at work), they slide off.What I like about Advent:  the sound is slightly better; the battery recharging is easy (plug it in and it recharges); they are more comfortable than the Sonys.What I didn't like about Advent:  there's no recharging stand; the tuning knob is in a really bad place (where you'd put your hands when you're putting the headphones on).I didn't really care about the range, because I'm really only using them in the same room.  One thing to be aware of: the Advent instruction manual (which nobody reads) says you should plug them into the LINE OUT and not the SPEAKER OUT port.  The line out has a much stronger signal (unless you turn up the volume on the sound source).  There's also an adjustment knob you're supposed to use to get the signal strength up to the right level.  Before I did these two things, I got a lot of noise.  After I read the instructions and set up a strong signal, I had almost no noise.Overall I really love them.  I can listen to music really loud without bothering my officemate, and they're comfortable enough to wear all day without trouble.[December 2003]I no longer use these headphones for day to day use.  After about six months, I got too annoyed with the sound fading in and out, the increasing amount of hiss, and the random loss of stereo signal.  I'm back to using regular wired headphones, this time spending only $18 on an Aiwa pair that I like.

They have more than enough range - I can even go well outside, and still hear the music just fine. They are not quite five stars, though, due to not being fully 'fi', so to speak, and for the annoying need to use another plug cord to recharge the batteries.As far as some other reviewers talking about complications with tuning, maybe I just lucked out, but I had these things tuned in about three seconds. I've also never lost a signal randomly, or had the tuning slowly go out of phase as some others complained.  I will say, though, that the tuning knob on the headphones is right next to the volume knob, and it's very easy to accidentally bump the tuning knob when adjusting the headphones, or when one wants to adjust the volume.  But this is a minor complaint (though I would like to see advent begin to put the tuning knob on the side opposite the volume, or in some other less easily accesible spot).The lows are good, the highs are good, and the ear cushions are very comfy, even for my large head, for extended periods.  The cushions I find to hold in heat from my ears and cause sweating (sorry if that's gross, but you need to know this stuff to be informed). I've always had that problem with all cushioned headphones since many, many ages ago, and so is not a problem with just these headphones, but the Advents cause it sooner than others I have owned - they make a very airtight seal around your ears.For the price, and for the built-in rechargable batteries, these are an excellent deal in my opinion, and I've enjoyed having them and using them, and have just ordered another pair so that my partner and I both can use them to watch movies with explosions and/or loud orchestral soundtracks late at night.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Pretty darn good", "unixReviewTime": 1012608000, "reviewTime": "02 2, 2002"}

The instructions say the CD has sound.  It's supposed to alert you when it's done cleaning or whatever.  My product produced no sound at any time.

I know I am probably not supposed to do this, but sometimes there is a minor bit of stuff on a DVD and I use a wiper and put it back in the package for another use or two. I haven't seen a downside.

Typically, I clean them by \"breathing\" on the dirty DVD and using the inside of my T-shirt to wipe clean these DVDs.  However, I began to look for another solution that didn't involve my T-shirt.  This product ... the Allsop CD and DVD fast-wipes looked like a possible solution, so I ordered a pack.After giving them a try, I find they work well ... they don't get the worst of the fingerprints off without a little extra help (or in my case, a \"breath\" on the DVD), but they get about 95 percent of the fingerprints off quickly and easily.  The material is lint free and works as advertised.  20 CD/DVD shaped wipes come per pack.  Being shaped like a DVD is just a gimmick.  I usually fold them in half or quarters before wiping, so if they were square-shaped (and thus had a little more material) it might actually be more helpful than being shaped like a circle.  The instructions say that each wipe can be re-used until it becomes visably dirty or worn, so you can clean multiple DVDs per wipe.Overall, these are a good buy and work well at a reasonable price.

Before I discovered the velcro cable ties, I was using the plastic cable ties where you feed one end through a hole in the other end, pull until tight, and cut off the \"tail\".  But the thing I didn't like about the plastic cable ties is they can't be re-used and you have to cut them to remove them.  That's not a problem if you rarely mess with your equipment and cables, but in my case I seem to be upgrading something, moving something, repairing something, or throwing something away on a regular basis.  That meant I was regularly cutting a bunch of plastic cable ties, getting new ones, and re-tieing everything, which I sort of began to dread and then loath.  The velcro cable ties make it alot easier.There's is a somewhat peculiar skill involved in learning how to wrap these things around a bundle of cables and getting them tight, but once you figure it out, it's very simple and you can get them very tight if you want.

Indeed, as I inspected this cable before writing this review I marveled at the construction and materials. Both are first rate.This cable has traveled extensively - it was part of my travel kit when I was a road warrior consultant, and served me well in many US states as well as the Middle East on long and short assignments. Back to the strain reliefs: I would hastily pack and literally ball this cable up and throw it in my laptop case, yet the ends never damaged, which I attribute - in part - to the strain reliefs that kept crimps from breaking or fraying the conductors.Bottom line - this model is now USB 2.0 compatible and is built to last.

But while waiting for a company representative to answer one of my phone calls, it suddenly occurred to me that my father had once purchased a power cord for an old TV set at a hardware store, and with no regard even toward the make of TV.So I looked on Amazon, instantly found something that looked promising (the description \"Universal\" was admittedly encouraging), and in two days both the treadmill and I were back up and running.  The pedestrian exchange (in both senses of the word) would no doubt have proven satisfying to anyone of any age, generation, class, ethnicity or gender, amounting to no less than the discovery of one's autonomy in a world of high-priced experts and \"gotcha\" specialists.  Moreover, how reassuring it is whenever one discovers and comes into possession of the knowledge that previously had no doubt belonged to everyone but your own isolated, \"out-of-the-loop,\" lonely self.  I hesitate to say whether the cord was more empowering to me or the treadmill.  But don't be shocked if the product delivers what it promises--twice over.[Since writing the above, I've discovered a company (Essential Sounds Products, Inc.) claiming its power cord is \"Amazing,\" \"Innovative,\" \"Revolutionary\"--that after using it to supply power to, for example, an amplifier, the cord's owner will settle for nothing less (\"One listen, and nothing else will do\").  This possibility sort of blows my tribute to the universality of the common power cord, but I remain to be sold on the new, revolutionary product.  If it converts my television set to \"Smell-o-vision\" (for those of you old enough to remember) or my kitchen toaster to a turbo-charged forge suitable for alchemy experiments, I'll be persuaded.  Return for updates.][Argh. The ESP (the acronym for the manufacturer) power cord begins at well over a hundred and the power strip at five hundred.  I smell exploitation of musicians (and gearheads) who, like athletes, are sometimes willing to try anything for that winning edge. Better to buy this Belkin and, if it bothers you, paint it some other color and put an exorbitant price tag on it so people will think it's one of those elitist A.C. cords.]", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Power to the people", "unixReviewTime": 1251763200, "reviewTime": "09 1, 2009"}

They are a good overall gauge thickness and the snag less ends are very beneficial. You may have experienced the problem of untangling a phone cord, only to have the clip on the end bend over or worse yet snap off. The next time you use that cord it doesn't have anything to keep it in the wall. Well what Belkin did with these snag less cables was put twin ridges made out of a rubbery plastic, that puts the snap in clip in a valley down below the ridges. So if you are untangling, those ridges prevent other wires from snagging the clip. That is a great idea. That is not enough to make you want to buy the cable, if it weren't for the fact that it is overall a great cable. The seven-foot length is good for a small patch area, like when connecting your modem to a router, or when your cable or DSL modem and/or router are right next to your computer.The other nice thing is the price here at Amazon on these cables. I went into the local nationally famous office supply, and they were half again as much money. So overall it is a very nice combination. They also don't slow down your connection at all. I get the same exact connection speed when using the online speed tests when I use the 50-foot, or the 7-foot.Highly recommended.

But my 7 footers, shown on Amazon in an appropriately nicely formed loop, all arrived in a tight wad with sharp bends every 3 1/2 to 4 1/5 inches along the entire length, and then tightly bound in the middle with a wire tie. Each kink even created a discolored joint on the cable jacket. Cables don't like sharp bends (mine have 17 tight bends along a 7' cable), those kinks make cables hard to string and route along small spaces, they make a rat's nest behind my comm gear, and they jeopardize the integrity of the cable.C'mon Belkin, your \"Pro Series\" packaging is a silly gimmick, because at a thrifty $2.50 per cable, I'm betting dollars to donuts there's nothing special about your cables, no rare metals, no exotic coatings, no braided stainless shielding... it's a generic Ethernet cable. Nothing more, nothing less. Kindly treat it as such. Treat them kindly and fore go the glitzy packaging.Meanwhile, my 15' cables from Mediabridge happily arrived in a simple cardboard box, in a neat 5\" diameter coil. No kinks, no sharp bends. I try to order from Mediabridge when possible because they seem to know how to package and deliver cables that work out of the box, no fancy packaging, no rocket science, no need to hang a cable for a week to work out the kinks, just a sound cable. Unfortunately, they did not have 7-footers when I needed them. So I went with Belkin, after all it's just a cable.

It allows both storage and transfer since it works on any parallel port, which should be defined as \"bi-directional\" or \"EPP\". For best results, you should run the \"Parallel Port Accelerator\" program when the unit is connected. Computers have a limit on the number of IDE devices, and desktop computers have a limited number of bays. The disks are easily replaced to provide vast storage within the 100Mb limit. This device must be connected when all power is off, like with a parallel port printer. Backing up a small amount of data is not a problem, but large amount of data files will run slowly. The fastest transfer is with an internal IDE ZIP device.The \"User's Manual\" warns against using the Operating System to copy a disk. Use the Iomega \"Copy Machine\" program. Right click on the ZIP drive to select the Iomega \"Format\" function. Use \"Short Format\" to delete all data on an Iomega disk. The \"Long Format\" repairs a drive with errors, converts from another format, or removes all passwords. \"Write Protection\" protects against writing over data, a password can protect against both reading and writing files. You can also flag the ZIP drive as \"non-removable\" so it appears like a hard drive. The manual has the details. Most printers will operate from the printer port on this unit. The manual offers suggestions if this doesn't work.Parallel Port drives have their drive letter(s) assigned after the hard drive. Another Parallel Port unit can be connected to the first (\"daisy chaining\"). This changes the drive letter(s) assigned to CD-roms. A USB drive has its drive letter assigned after the CD-rom drive letter(s). Both units have been proven useful over time. Will the data on a disk survive for over a decade? Not with some floppy disks. Few hard drives survive 10 years of daily use. All your important data files should be copied from a hard drive to ZIP drives or other media. ZIP drives, like floppies, should not be exposed to magnetic fields or high heat. CDs can be damaged by high heat. ZIP disks are reusable, replacing data does not decrease the size. A CD disk consumes space when a file is replaced. Both can have labels. Some say ZIP drives are obsolete, but not as long as it works for you. A ZIP disk has no compatibility problems between different systems and computers. A CD written on one system may not be updated by a different system.To test the status of a used ZIP disk. 1) Right click on the drive, select `Properties'. 2) Select the Iomega tab (after support was installed). 3) Select `Diagnostics', then `Close' after the green light. 4) Select `More Info' on the `Disk Type' Note the `Disk Life Status' and the `Format Life Status'. Percentages lower than about 85% are not good. 5) A `Long Format' can improve the Life Status statistics.If your system does not recognize your used parallel port drive (Add New Hardware Wizard), select the hardware from the list: \"SCSI controllers\", \"Iomega\", \"Iomega Parallel Port Interface\", then \"Finish\".", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Flexible Data Storage and Transfer", "unixReviewTime": 1231977600, "reviewTime": "01 15, 2009"}

My only gripe is that Iomega does not make these drives with an on/off switch... even if your computer is off for a week, you've got to unplug your ZIP drive if you don't want it to eat up electricity. Honestly, I doubt that a little ZIP drive that isn't spinning a disk uses more than a single kilowatt hour per month, but it's a waste nonetheless.  This one gripe wasn't enough of a drawback to take a star away from the 5 star rating I'm giving this gizmo.  It's dependable, it's fast and ZIP is an industry standard.

Now the solution-of-choice only for older machines (more than 2 years), or for mobile professionals who want to make absolutely sure that they'll be able  to connect a ZIP drive to any PC they encounter, this most basic ZIP drive  should be avoided by most purchasers.Fact is, if you need to be mobile  with your ZIP, you should go the USB route these days.  Every new PC and  Macintosh comes with USB connectivity, and the difference in access speed  is great enough to justify the minimal extra cost.  This parallel port  machine is the very slowest ZIP drive available.  If  you download files of  any size (1M or more) you will notice the difference.You'll also notice  the difference between this model and an internal model.  Make sure that  you really need to be mobile with the drive itself before you choose an  external model.  As has been stated in other reviews, the ZIP-100 has  become something of a standard nowadays, and many machines come with a ZIP  drive pre-installed.Also, even though the price is attractive, think  carefully about choosing this model if you plan to do much printing.  Most  printers use the parallel port, and although you can hook up both a printer  and this drive to the same port, you can't use both simultaneously.  This  is disasterous if you attempt to print a file from the ZIP drive.  It can  be done, but it takes a lot longer than printing from other drives.  Also,  forget about accessing the ZIP drive if you've sent a print command.  Your  parallel ZIP drive will be unavilable for the duration of the print.Having said all this, I absolutely agree with other reviewers who praise  the ZIP-100 format.  It's got the broadest-based installation of any ZIP  format, so chances are you'll be able to port your data more successfully  with a ZIP-100 than any other format.  True, 100mb is starting to look like  small, but it's still an awful lot of room for almost everything but  full-motion, full-sound video.Still, I have to give this product fewer  stars than it would've deserved two years ago, simply because Iomega has  come out with better stuff in the interim.  For many users, it would be  wiser to buy an internal ZIP-100.  Or, better still, buy an external USB  ZIP-100 for current compatability, and leave the internal bay available for  future installation of a JAZ-2MB.  That way, you'll create a removable  media solution that handles both past and future needs.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not the wisest choice for most users", "unixReviewTime": 959731200, "reviewTime": "05 31, 2000"}

I've used the Zip since its inception when it knocked old Syquest 88MB  drives out of business about 5 years ago.  The size and convenience is why  there is really only one choice for removable media with easy and immediate  read-write capability.There are definite pluses and minuses.  Some will  say get a CD-R(W) drive - but burning a CD is definitely not as immediate  as a Zip. The parallel port is a major bummer because of the thru-speed.  But those of you who are not major speed demons won't be disappointed  compared to a floppy.  The Zip drive allows daisy chaining so you can  connect/output to other peripherals.Iomega cut cost on the power  on/off (it's always on when plugged in).  But really the overall design is  very good - you can place it flat or vertical.  Even though the thick  parallel cord may tend to twist the main unit.There are a plethora of  other Iomega choices.  And I would really ask yourself if you are planning  on USB or SCSI - each are noticeably faster.  On the plus side, the 100MB  format is so common in print shops, university labs, and copy places that  you can't go wrong.  Plus the price of each disk is recognizably less than  the 250MB.  Seriously think about your file formats.  If you plan to do a  lot video - you'll need to go with a Jaz.  And you can get these  refurbished for about the same cost and hold 1Gig.

There is no doubt that it a good case and it looks really nice with the Vx. With the case on, it very little to the overall size of the palm. The silo design of the Vx which allows you to attach the case to the palm was ingenious. It a huge leap in case design compared to the velcro concept of may PDA's.As for this case it is made of high quality leather and it a loop/strap design that i also liked. Velcro and the button proved that after prolonged use, it tends to rip. The loop/strap design secures the case very well and it still looks very elegant.However like many leather products, they tend to warp and deform after a while. Just think of your wallet and how deformed that can get. If your going to be putting it in your pocket a lot, i suggest you go with the hard case. However if your going to be putting it in a bag or brief case, then this case will be fine.Although the case has slots for credit cards or business cards, realistically you wouldnt want to put more than two credit card and 3 business cards in it at one time. It does a lot to the bulkiness of the case. Personally I only carried 4 business cards in it at one time.Reatively speaking i wanted a case that was smaller then this one because it got a little too big for my pockets, whether it be the shirt or pant pocket. i found that not only was the hardcase by palm smaller and almost weighed as much, it also protected it just as well.Also the fact that the powerbutton was often times turn on when using the leather case convinced me to change to the hard case.Dont get me wrong. I really like this case. The hard case just fit my needs for a case a lot better then the slim leather case.The best thing i can suggest is to try both of them out before you actually buy it. A lot of stores will let you try on the case.

I prefer it over other cases for the following reasons:The first is portablity.  I take my Palm everywhere with me (even to the little boy's room).  And with the case's slim size, my Palm fits easily into my front pants pocket.  (Carrying my Palm in my shirt pocket is also an option.  But since my company switched to business casual attire, I no longer wear dress shirts with pockets to work.  Hooray!)The second reason is convenience.  With the Palm rail system, the unit is held securely.  And when I need to sync, the case slides off cleanly (the rail system being a simpler and much more elegant solution than the pocket or Velcro holding methods of other products).The third reason is protection.  The rigid cover is slightly padded, and the loop closure is very secure.  (Before adopting this case, I once used another cover -- without a loop closure -- which failed to protect my Palm when I accidentally dropped it in the street while I waited on the curb for a cab.)  The loop closure is also easy to open, so access to my Palm is not restricted.My last reason for selecting this case is its ability to hold business cards.  I put my business cards (a whole slew of them) in the large inside pocket, and I put my kids' doctor and dentist appointment reminders in the multiple credit card slots, none of which I want to carry in my wallet (which is already filled with plenty of other stuff).  Since my Palm is always with me, I'm never without a business card, so I never miss an opportunity to have my name remembered by the many new customers or vendors I meet.(As a comparison, many of the hard cases are very stylish.

First and foremost I must say that this case sure beats the hell out of the hard case, which is also manufactured by  3Com, in both form and function.  Second it can hold credit cards and money  to be used as a second wallet, although it is not a great idea to use it as  a primary substitute.  And thirdly, the hard case is about ten dollars more  than the leather case and is not nearly as good.However, like all  things, it does have it's downsides.  It's biggest flaw, like with other  cases, is that it makes placing the Palm in the craddle (while still in the  case) a little more difficult.  You basically need to place the craddle up  on something (upside-down cup for example) and pull back both sides of the  case all the way and then you can recharge.  Secondly, the pockets are made  so stiff inside that it is very tricky to get both money or credit cards  into or out of the pockets, which is why you might want to stick to a  regular wallet.  And thirdly, if you place the cased palm in a tight space  like a bag or something, there is a chance that the edge of the case will  hit the power button and cause it to turn on.  This is not a big deal since  it will shut off automatically after a minute or so, however it can become  annoying when you haven't charged your palm in a while and you find that  your battery is dying for some strange reason.All in all, you can't do  much better than this case for only $19.95, and while there may be more  expensive cases on the market, they are all variations of this simple  design.  However, I would say that it would be nice it 3Com or Palm would  make a case like this that went all the way around the palm for protection  on all sides, since something can get caught between your palm and the case  and end up scratching the screen (which almost happened to me).Final  thoughts: nice leather, don't expect it to take the same beating as the  hard case, but unless you plan to go hiking with your palm, don't shovel  out the extra ten bucks for a shoddy hard case, get this nice leather one  instead.Revuman:  Stay Tuned for more Reviews...peace!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice case, OK wallet, better than the hard case", "unixReviewTime": 958262400, "reviewTime": "05 14, 2000"}

To be sure, it is an improvement  on that device. It's noticeably faster.  But it's smart for only a couple  of  very specific kinds of user.The first is the \"Backup Bandit\".  If  you only use your zip drive for routine, automated backup of files that fit  easily onto a single 100mb disk, it's unlikely you need much more than this  device.The second is the \"I've-had-a-Zip-for-years Geek\".  If you have  a huge library of Zip 100 disks already amassed, and the average file size  is above 10mb, then there's an argument to be made for staying with this  product.  Notice that I'm talking here about a library of truly BIG files,  typically graphics.  If all you have is a massive library of text  documents, you shouldn't fear switching over to the Zip 250 at all.In  my opinion, anyone else should go for the USB version of the Zip 250, and  add on a FireWire adapter when it becomes available.Why?Well,  the Zip 250 USB with FireWire is simply the most flexible Zip out there.  You can use it on literally any system that has at least USB ports, can  achieve the lightning speeds of internal SCSI Zips if the computer has  FireWire ports--and you don't have to sacrifice a scrap of portability.  While the Zip 100 here can be fitted out with a FireWire adapter, it can't  use Zip 250 disks.  True, the Zip 250 is mysteriously slower than a Zip 100  if the files are something above 10mb.  But you'll never notice the  difference with the vast majority of files.  What you will notice if you  spend any time seriously archiving your work is how nice it would be to  have a little bit more room on a 100mb disk.  The Zip 250 solves that  problem by giving you a lot more room to play in.  In particular, the 250s  are obviously better-suited to sharing larger multimedia files between  computers, or even between platforms.  Finally, the 250 simply LOOKS  cooler.  Those looks even translate into utility, because its trim profile  really does make it a little easier to carry.In fairness I should point  out that the 100mb appears to have a substantially lower price tag.  But  it's not, really.  You pay on average 1.5 times as much for Zip 100 disks  (per megabyte of storage space) than for Zip 250s.  Long term, your storage  savings with a Zip 250 more than make up for the up-front difference  between the two models.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "There are better Zip drives out there", "unixReviewTime": 968457600, "reviewTime": "09 9, 2000"}

I can then tell it to copy the pictures to my Photo library, and delete the originals. It does just that. Then on the Mac and PC, I tell the operating system to eject the drive/device, then I can pop the adapter out of the computer. Of course you can pop it out whenever you want, but you will definitely risk something bad, better to eject it the proper way.

Why did I mention that? Because this case has recently undergone a \"refresh\" as they put it, which means they re-designed it. The newer version, which is what I received from Data Vision, has way more pockets and space than the much older original version. I contacted another large supplier and they in fact had the older version, and were charging more money. You will notice that it is selling for much more from all of the other suppliers. The new one is great.This model, unlike some of the competition is all leather on the outside. Lesser models have leather faces on them, but then they have plastic sides. There is plenty of room for everything in here. I have a 15.4 inch laptop, and I can store the large section of the A/C adapter in the same section. They even have an adjustable dividing flap in that section so it does not touch your laptop. The remaining detachable plug in cord of the adapter goes in the compartmentalized section of the case with all of the other items, like wireless mouse, cable connector for myVantec LapCool 4 LPC-420 Foldable Notebook Cooler with 4-Port Hub (Black)which sits neatly under the laptop since folded up for transport it only takes up .9 inches of space. (9/10ths of one inch) So this case has ample room for my HP 50G-133US laptop as well as the .9 inch cooler sitting underneath. With the velcro secured tie down strap, nothing moves.There are more compartments on the other side as well. The pictures illustrating this case are a mish mosh of both series. The one I received from Data Vision, the newer \"refresh\" version as they call it, is the one you see in photo number 1, the featured photo. If you notice the second picture and other pictures are a different case, the older version. You can easily see the difference because the older one has a long pad on the strap, and the new one has an oval, adjustable one. By visiting Targus's website you can see photos of the new one in its completeness. I would upload those photos, but I think it is smart to leave the mix, since that is what some of the suppliers are selling.This case has a definite luxury about it. They have their top cases going for 4 times as much, but this one really fills the bill nicely; it's executive material without going over the top.

Amazon may not charge shipping if one re orders when this happens, but you would probably lose it if you requested a refund.Be aware this is the FIRST time an Amazon seller has done this to my knowledge in over 15 years of business with Amazon (I am very happy with Amazon and appreciate their costomer service), so I just wanted to help if you pay for shipping.

Let me set the scene:I go into the library for a nice, long afternoon of studying. I don't feel comfortable leaving my laptop on the table whenever I go to the bathroom, so I bring this Targus Defcon CL along to secure my computer for whenever I'm not at the table. I connect it and get on with my studying. Come dinnertime, I feel it's time to go, so I put the combo in the lock and IT WON'T UNLOCK. WTF.I am getting frantic, thinking maybe I've gone insane and forgot the combo (which would be impossible since it's the digits of my freaking date of birth). Desperate, I Google \"Targus Defcon CL won't open\". Lo and behold, this exact same thing has happened to hundreds of other people!! The Amazon reviews alone are almost all about how the combo will randomly change on you! Now I'm trippin out, so I start Googling a way to open the piece of crap up without the combo. Luckily, engagdet.com did an article a few years ago about how easy it is to cut the cable or to decipher the combination of these things.I drive home to grab a strong set of wire cutters, and come back to cut the cable. Takes me about 10 minutes to cut through, with a 7\" wire cutter (something a person can have in their pocket while you're away from your comp, spend 10 min, and be off with your laptop in their hands). Unfortunately, during that 10 min duration, someone reports me to the librarian because they think I'm trying to steal a laptop. I have to log in to the computer to prove that it's mine. Slightly embarrassing, but even he thought it was hilarious that the lock not only messed up my combo, but was pretty easy to cut through.SO, to recap, the reasons this is the WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED:1) IT WILL RANDOMLY CHANGE THE COMBO. THIS HAS HAPPENED IN MORE CASES THAN NOT (Google it).2) The cable literally takes 5-10 minutes with a mediocre set of cutters to get through.

My unit came with a 32MB memory cartidge, the serial port connection cord, the USB programmer cord, the 12V power cord for the cigarette lighter, the &quot;sticky&quot; dash mount, and a MapSource CD with codes to unlock one region (the US and Canada consisted of 5-6 regions, IIRC). I have since bought the beanbag dash mount and a 128MB card and purchased the &quot;unlock all regions&quot; option for City Navigator--probably already included items for a new purchase in today's package. Additionally, I downloaded the &quot;British&quot; voice package from Garmin's website to replace the default &quot;American&quot; voice--the British lady's voice seems less harsh and less like a drill sergeant when giving directions!I love this unit because it makes navigation so easy--isn't that the idea behind a GPSR? With the CityNav map information loaded into the memory card (and with 128MB it fits all of PA, DE, MD, and D.C. and good chunks of WV, OH, NY, and NJ) I am able to get turn-by-turn directions to nearly any street address. If you ask it to route you to a given destination, the unit actually tells you when a turn is coming up, e.g. &quot;In point two miles exit right,&quot; or &quot;In 500 feet turn left.&quot; If you are driving without a destination selected, the unit will display the cross streets by name as you approach. You can zoom the map in for street detail or zoom out to see more of the countryside. If you have a destination selected, the unit will zoom in automatically as you approach and zoom in even more for a detailed overview of approaching intersections as you near a turn.If you are in an area for which you do not have the MapSource detail loaded, the unit still has an internal base map that contains cities, highways, interstates, and major bodies of water, so it can still route you from city to city using the major roads. This makes driving long distances cross-country feasible and you can load up the memory card with the areas you expect to spend most of your time in if you don't have enough memory for the entire route.However, in those areas for which you do have the map detail loaded you can get turn-by-turn directions to an address or even select various destinations (restaurants, attractions, banks, shopping centers, etc.) listed by name and/or distance. The unit also displays address and phone information for those destinations, which is useful to call ahead and make reservations or check for vacancy if you're the spontaneous weekend tourist like I am.The 16-color display is beautiful--major routes are in red, arterials in thick black, minor streets in thin black, rivers and lakes in blue, parks and golf courses in green, and the background will change at sunset or sunrise to yellow (daylight) or black (night) as appropriate (the black streets will also switch to white at night).Please note that the map detail, which includes streets and popular destinations, is a feature of the map software, not the unit itself. Garmin seems to issue updated map software on an annual basis, but you must pay for those updates. I'm still using CityNav 4.1, although Garmin's website states that 6.0 is coming out this summer. The new 6.0 software will probably contain more business listings and reflect more recent road construction, but I'm doing fine with 4.1 and don't see a need yet to pay for the upgrade. One reviewer complained about the lack of Starbucks locations with his map, and I expect Garmin will be adding more and more types of businesses like that as time goes by.Enough babbling--in summary, here are some pros of this unit:o Cheaper than most in-dash GPS systemso Portable, so you can share the unit with your &quot;fleet&quot; or take it along in a rental car (and you'd best hide it or take it with you when parking so it doesn't get stolen)o Voice navigation, so you can anticipate an upcoming turn without having to take your eyes off the roado Color display--so much better than a gray scale map!o Accurate and helpful when driving somewhere unfamiliaro Automatic route recalculation if you miss a turn or have to detouro Address and phone info for listed businesses/sites so you can call aheadAnd the cons I've experienced:o Voice navigation could be somewhat improved for confusing intersections--do I take a right or sharp right at this five-way?o Eats batteries--but this unit is too bulky to walk around with, so there is no reason it should ever be used without being plugged into your cigarette lighter.o Awkward interface--entering street names or address numbers is awkward with the rocker buttono Loses signal in built-up areas with tall buildings--usually when you are downtown and *really* need directions the most, unfortunately! However, this is a problem with all GPS receivers and due more to the nature of the GPS system than the unit itself.All in all, I love my SPIII. It has all the features I really need. There are units out there that are newer, have more features, and may be easier to use, but they're also more expensive.

Parry", "helpful": [6, 6], "reviewText": "Please allow me to preface this review with the fact that I have absolutely no sense of direction.  For those with excellent sense of direction, this may seem like an extravagant purchase until they come down in cost.I had to travel to California recently (I only lived there my whole life before 1999), but since I had never driven in California before, I was quite nervous about doing so.  The rental car had a GPS very similar to the Street Pilot, and using that gave me a great sense of confidence in driving around.Shortly after my return I realized how badly we needed a GPS in our car.  The Street Pilot was the best option for us because it has all the features of a factory-installed auto GPS, but the added convenience of being portable- now when I head out of town I can take the Street Pilot rather than having to rent a car with a GPS.  Not to mention the Street Pilot is about 1/2 to 1/3 of the cost of a factory-installed system.Some of the other reviewers have complained about how long it takes the Street Pilot to recalculate a route once the vehicle has gone off-route.  I have intentionally gone off-route several times just to see how it performs, and I have been very pleased.  It does take a few seconds, but from my experience it did not take so long that I got any further off-course than I already was.A feature that I found to be very helpful in the Street Pilot which was not in the rental car's GPS is a search by company name.  If you're looking for a department store, but you can't remember its address, just search by the name, and the Street Pilot will navigate you to the closest one. If you're looking for that great Chinese restaurant a couple of miles away, but you can't remember the name, you can search for Chinese restaurants in your area and find the correct one based on its address.  Want to order ahead, or put your name on the seating list?  Once the Street Pilot finds the restaurant you're looking for, it displays their phone number on the monitor as well.About the only two complaints I have about the Street Pilot are very trivial.  On the rental car I used, the GPS would automatically lower the volume on the stereo when the GPS needed to announce an instruction.  Being an external unit, the Street Pilot does not have this luxury.  Since I tend to listen to music, well, at ear-splitting volume while driving, it does take a little getting used to lowering the volume when using the Street Pilot around town, but again, this is a very minor complaint given all of the positive features the Street Pilot has.My other complaint is that occasionally it does give directions which are not the most direct route.  I used this on a trial basis in areas I was familiar with just to see how it performs, and I did find myself thinking on occasion \"why is it telling me to go this way, when that way is much more direct?\"  Especially since I live within a half an hour of Garmin's world headquarters, it would seem to me that they would at least know the most direct routes around here!  But even at this, the Street Pilot DOES get you to the correct destination every time, even if it sometimes takes an indirect route.I noticed that the package includes both a beanbag mount and a permanent dashboard mount for the Street Pilot.  Since Street Pilots have a way of being swiped, my suggestion would be to always use the beanbag mount, since a permanent mount could cause thieves to break into the car to find the GPS that is no longer in the car.  I drive a new Jetta, and I did not want to get sticky stuff all over my dashboard, so I chose to try out the beanbag.  It does not slip, even when making sharp turns.  I suppose if I were in a collision this would not be the case, but in normal driving, the beanbag is great.Of course, as others have advised, do not leave your Street Pilot in the car unattended for any reason.  But given the fact that you're going to be spending around $1G for this puppy you probably already knew that.And one other safety feature that I think is great, but others might be annoyed by it: once you are driving, you cannot change the destination; it goes into a secure mode.  To change the address, you need to stop the car.  This may be a nuisance to some, but given how badly people drive while talking on cell phones, it's probably best that Garmin tries to curb people from pressing all sorts of buttons on their GPS while zipping down the road at 75 MPH.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Expensive, but a VERY worthwile investment!", "unixReviewTime": 1052438400, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2003"}

Farmer", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "After recently purchasing a new Palm Vx, I thought it would be a good idea to invest in a better form of protection than the included leatherette flap. The Palm V hard case is about the only sleek option that there is at the moment.The case attaches to the Palm V via the left stylus storage area. A stylus shaped piece attaches the Palm to the hinge in the case. The case itself opens like a book and allows the Palm to move much like a page in the book. Located behind the Palm on the inside of the case is an area to store a business card or other small piece of paper. The case comes together nicely and has a cut out for the IR port as well as the right stylus.Pros:1) Protects as advertised. The point of a hard case should be adequate protection first of all, and this case delivers as advertised. The aluminum reinforced plastic shell hugs the Palm V tightly and securely.2) Allows for IR port usage while resting in case.3) Case does not allow for you to accidentally turn the unit on while in your pocketCons:1) Heavy: One of the selling points for the Palm V series is the sleek, lightweight design. While this case may not seem like too much additional weight, the combination of the Palm V in the case is noticeably heavier. In fact my wife's Palm III and my Palm V weigh about the same now.2) Obstructive: hot sync is really only accomplished by taking the unit out of the case due to the girth of the case itself. A friend of mine who has a keyboard tried to rest the unit on the keyboard and found the case too cumbersome for this purpose as well.3) Hand holding the unit is more difficult. With the included leather flap, you are able to fold it behind the unit to easily hold the Palm in one hand. The hard case does not fold back on itself, which means there is a much larger surface area to support while using the Palm. This is especially annoying for me since I use my Palm frequently while standing or walking here and there.4) ...Overall, I think the hard case is best suited for someone who is looking to provide the best protection for his or her Palm in the smallest package. You will have to decide if the increased weight and obtrusiveness of the case is worth the added protection it offers. At this time, I am still using the case, but I anticipate going back to the default leather flap in the future when I grow tired of the Cons listed above.Thanks for your time...", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good protection comes with a trade off", "unixReviewTime": 1009670400, "reviewTime": "12 30, 2001"}

The only difference of the silver case and the blue special edition case other than color is the logo in the front. The blue one has the circular palm logo while the silver one has the dotted \"P\" logo of palm, like the one that you see whenever you reset the unit. I first bought the slim leather case for my Vx and after i used it for about 2 months, i became quite dissatified with it. One of the reasons why i was not happy with the slim case was because it made the whole Vx a lot bigger then it really is. Also after a few months the leather case had a few noticable scratches. It also began to warp. I decided to find an alternative. After much thought i decided to get the hard case for the Vx.  At first i was discouraged that i had to remove the case every time i hotsynced. However after heeding the suggestions of many others i found that proping it up on a book or a bunch of cd cases actually works well. I dont think there is any other case that allows you to sync that easy without removing the case. In that aspect i dont think there is a better case. However i discover that you have to insert the unit properly for the case to open and stay closed right. If you dont push the case far enough into the silo it really wont work right. If you insert the unit properly it opens and closes brilliantly.The spring loaded feature of the case is probably its best feature. When opening and closing the case it is very noticable that there is more tension opening the case then there is closing. In that aspect there is really no other case out there at offers that.One thing that i disliked about the slim leather case was that often times the buttons were accidentally pressed. whether it was the application buttons or the power button, it often got pressed even with the leather case firmly closed. That was not the case for the hard case. Although the contrast button was pressed occationally pressed, its extremely rare.Also with the hard case firmly shut, the unit is allowed to move a little, just enough to allow some impact to be absorbed when you accidentally bump or drop it.Finally and more importantly the case is one of very few that actually protects the unit, looks good and maintains the shape and sleekness of the Vx.

Since it's called a hard case, I expected it, well, to be HARD.  But it's not.  It's plastic with a thin metal cover on the front and back that look more like they are there for fashion than funciton.  The metal sides will give if you try to bend it.  Also, I think the closing mechanism is terrible.  You have to get the Palm in there just right for it to close completely and even then, it's not a tight seal.  And usually when it's put in this way, the top of the case will hit the contrast button and you'll have to keep fixing it so you can view the screen. It does not snap together, which annoys me.  While the case itself may not stay shut, the Palm *is* securely held in the case, which is one good thing about this case. It has a holder similair to the stylus, so you just slide it in one of your stylus slots.  I prefer this way of attaching the Palm, rather than some other cases which use Velcro.

It's almost like the people at Palm want our PDA's to break so they can sell us more.  I don't see why there's so much emphasis on making the cases as small as possible.

No real complaints with them - sure reduced the amount of shelf space my DVDs required, and allows me to organize by genre.  The sleeves are held in a 3-ring binder, so they can be pulled out and re-arranged, too, so if you like to keep your DVDs alphabetically, you can pop a new CD into the stream without having to move every DVD like one would have to with the stupid other caselogic cases that don't have removable pages.  The material is strong adn well made.  I very much like the leather look and feel of the case, and they look sharp on the shelf.  The zippers are strong and well formed, the rivets are good, the binder material is sturdy. These babies will last for a good long time.My only complaint with this case - and also the 10 DVD holder from caselogic - is that they really don't hold that many without bulging or overpacking. I figure the 20 DVD holder averages about 18 discs, and the 10 holder gets 8 or 9.  Figure it this way - I have 8 of these holders. One holder when I bought it was missing 5 sleeves.  But even though I started 5 sleeves less I should have, it doesn't matter, becuase after filling all the holders to their capacity, I have about 20 sleeves left over that I can't use, becuase the case holders aren't big enough to hold as many DVDs as they say.The other caveat is that they have no place in which to put a label to let you know what's inside them.  I thought of putting stickers onthem, but realized that open and closing them would eventually force the stickers to come undone, and look ugly. So what I did, and I recommend this to you, is to make small cardstock labels with the contents of the case (I sort mine by genre, so mine say \"Action\" or \"Science fiction\", and each genre has it's own color scheme, etc. I did not put the movie names on the labels, cuz one never knows when one will need to move a movie to another case to make room for another, eh?), and then tied some string to them and put the string through the hole in the zipper handle. This system works wonderfully, and if you make really nice cards for them, they look good, too.For those two reasons, I only give these 4 stars.Those caveats aside, these are wonderful - the sleeves have room to put the front page or other amterials from the DVD, space for the disc itself (they can even fit 2 DVDs in them, for those double DVD sets like Star Wars).  They reduced my shelving needs by about 80%, and for that, it's worth the cost,...

Killion", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "Well since most reviews have gone into the specifics of this device, I won't delve too deeply into those aspects. However, very rarely did I see any mention of how cheap of a device this is; the plastic feels of very low grade, the reset button litterally rattles it's so loose. Overall, yes the device works, so I won't knock it for that; unfortunately I have no means of testing the actual surge-protection, but I just have to hope that they used better quality electronic components then they used for the case build.Pros of the device:-----------------------+Smart circle design; obviously the main advantage of this is taht you are no longer limited by annoying power bricks taking up/blocking outlets. For that it works great.+Cute design; it looks slightly better than a normal surge protector with its circle form factor and brightly color coded outlets; however, the design is slightly hindered by how cheap the materials are, and looks less cute in person.+Long cord; 16ft is pretty long, so make sure you need that long of a cord, since the average cord length is around 6-8ft for a surge protector. Still for my application, a long cord is a plus (since I needed at least a 12ft cord).Cons:----------Really bad build quality; again, just super cheap plastic, and the reset button is really wobbly, barely feels like it's held on. The cord seems of decent gauge/insulation at least, and the device has some heft so it may just be cheap on the exterior.-No swivel outlet; for the cost of this device, it really should come with a swivel outlet connection, so if your outlet is upside-down (connected to a light switch) or you need it to go to the right of the socket, the cord will be tweaked in the wrong direction. I have no problems with cheap protectors not having a rotating outlet, but on something that costs almost $40 it really should have included it.Summary:-------Look, if we're rating the device on whether it provides power or not, of course it works, and should get 5 stars. The circle design is also very nice, and again worthy of some stars. But with how poor the build quality is on this (and this was ordered from Amazon directly, not 3rd party), and the fact that they didn't even throw in nicer features like a swivel socket for how pricey this retails for, I can't give this a fantastic rating (but will still give it an OK rating as it does in fact work, but that alone doesn't deserve 5 stars). I purchased the device on a Cyber-Monday sale, and even at the significantly-reducted price I'm still debating on if I should keep it or not. I have several surge protectors from all sorts of brands, and as such I'm somewhat disappointed with what should have been a nicer protector feeling and looking so cheap. I'd say for a sale price it might be worth it, or if you're really looking for a longer cord surge protector it might be worth it (although I have several longer-cord protectors that didn't cost near this much), but I've purchased much better protectors at even better prices when they go on sale.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Poor build-quality, but otherwise it does what it should", "unixReviewTime": 1354665600, "reviewTime": "12 5, 2012"}

I had long wanted a hand held organizer, one that would have both computer interchangeable abilities and one that would be able to perform different applications. Christmas day was a happy one for me last year, not only because of the brimming smiles on my children's faces; but because that is when I received the Palm V as a gift from my Santa (my wife!).After giving the product and it's instructions a look over, within moments I was on my way and began the charging procedures necessary prior to it's use. This was my only initial disappointment, having to wait for the initial charging that takes 4 hrs. I couldn't wait to tinker with my new toy, and it was a bit annoying. After completing the charge up, I installed the cd that came with the product to familiarize myself with it. The cd is both quite informative and very easy to follow. Then I was ready to begin to learn about my new toy.Looks can be deceiving when it comes to the appearance of the Palm V. In viewing the device, with it's ultra sleek, thin design; one might come to the conclusion it could be nothing more than your basic address/date book. This little &quot;power packer&quot; (as I like to call it) is simply amazing!The applications that can be utilized with the Palm V as well as the storage capacities are as follows:1) Address book: that holds up to 6000 addresses2) Appointment record: that records up to 3000 appointments3) E-mail functioning: that can receive up to 200 e-mail messages4) Memo pad: that can hold up to 1500 memos5) To Do List: that records up to 1500 to-do items6) Expense Reports7) Games8) Security9) Calculator(All storage figures are approximate, and flexible according to the overall storage capacity of 2 MB)The Palm V also comes complete with the necessary software to facilitate all functions on the organizer. Other items that came with my Palm V were the synchronizing cradle &amp; battery recharger, the handbook, an adapter, a protective cover, and one metal stylus and a spare plastic one.While the Palm V comes to you with all the pre-programming stated in my epinion, it also has the capability of being able to receive downloads from the internet to expand its functions, or to simply download games to play on this hand held device.The ease of operation of the Palm V is remarkable. On it's face are are 5 buttons on the metal frame and an area on screen with 4 buttons (to be used with the stylus), as well as an area for information input or free hand graffiti writing. All of these help the user quickly and efficiently operate the Palm V to expedite the tasks at hand. The device also has a back light that can come in rather handy.Input of information into the Palm V can be done in a number of ways. One can access the keyboard on the device, or use special graffiti free hand writing to input the desired material. The device may also be directly hooked up to your PC and the information typed in with your computer's keyboard.The greatest thing about the Palm V is the ability to transfer data between the device and your computer. The ability to be able to access e-mail, download information from the internet or your computer, for me is a God send; and in my opinion nothing sort of revolutionary! To process the transference of information, the Palm V needs to be placed into the HotSync cradle. Then the user just presses the HotSync button on the device to perform the HotSync operation. It proves to be completely user friendly as far as the exchange between the organizer and the computer.Maintaining your organizer requires as little as a few minutes charging a day of the Palm V, by placing it in its cradle. No need to buy batteries, it is self contained with a Lithium ion rechargeable battery. It is so small in size and weighs a mere 4 ounces, it easily is carried in a coat pocket; both comfortably and unnoticed.My main use for the Palm V is during my business hours. It is always on my person, for me to access at a moment's notice, to jot down things I need to remember (which are many with my bad recall). Whether it be to record an appointment that I have just confirmed with a client, or a note to myself; the Palm V has become an invaluable device; one that has proven to make my day much more pleasant and hassle free. No more need to run to a desk for a paper or pen, or to ask my callers to hold on; I am always ready with my Palm V on hand.If you do not have any prior experience with a hand held organizer of this kind, and always thought about purchasing one, I would highly recommend the Palm V. Once you have had a device like this, you will never want to be without one. Just like all the modern luxuries in life, what you don't have you do without and don't miss; but what you've had and have no longer, is greatly missed and still desired for easier living.

Technically, because of the additional  memory, the  Vx is faster. Nonetheless, because Palm  applications are so small, this  difference is truly  negligible. Therefore, before you spend $100 more on  the Vx, make sure you're going to use the additional memory. It's the  only difference.Now, remember: the V  series is rechargable, while the III series uses  AAA  batteries. Therefore, travelling with a V palm means you'll have to  carry around the cradle.

To my brother, wife &amp; parents who conspired for my birthday: THANK YOU!!!!!  Within two weeks I abandoned my Franklin Planner, and regretted not having had a Palm device 15 years ago.  OK, that was impossible - but it has dramatically changed my life for the  better, and I can't imagine ever going without it. In the last several  months I have grown to be a very definite power user, and the corporate  resource person for Palm-platform PDA's. Our guys have tried several others  and are convinced that the Palm platform is the best and most flexible.  I  am very heavily into 3rd-party software evaluation (&amp; some  accessories), preparing recommendations for high-efficiency Palm  device/software packages for company-staff issue. Eventually I may put  together my own personal web-site, and post some evaluations and  recommendations for software/accessories for Palm users.Having said all  that, here's an engineer's (my)perspective on the Palm V: Visors will be  great, and Palm IIIx's are just fine, but the Palm V package size is  definitely worth a lot to me. Forget the sexy appearance - it's great, but  the superior Form Factor rules. Yes, I would prefer that the Vx cost is  about what the standard V discounts for now, but since it will ALWAYS fit  in my shirt pocket (without changing my shirt wardrobe) I ALWAYS have it  with me (in a place that's probably least susceptible to being damaged or  lost) - and that's what it's for. Though I prefer to use the slim padded  3COM case, I frequently slip the original leather flap-cover on for small  shirt pockets, &amp; thus can still carry a separate pen/pencil/stylus  device. A big plus with those covers that I've never seen in a review: the  soft \"grabby\" texture of the rubber-like spine flex keeps the Palm from  sliding, even if you do toe-touches. Ta-dah... it doesn't fall out on the  floor!!!!  (Very big benefit since the cover isn't a padded case.)Likes:  I like being able to keep synced with both my office laptop and my home  desktop (with the included MS Outlook Conduit)... autocharging in the docking  cradle... a battery that's never gotten below a half-charge... nice screen...  the size.  I really like the unit overall - a truly great device.Any  problems? Yep. I did have to get the updated e-mail patch from the Chapura  site to avoid some lock-ups when synching e-mail.  Also, I highly recommend  TealScript (the custom-tailorable graffitti add-on) for it's ability to  help you tune up your handwriting speed/recognition - and it visually  showed up a mysterious problem with the screen occasionally screwing up  handwriting by adding a horizontal line: 3-COM quickly replaced it under  warranty, and it's been fine.Memory space? The average user probably  will have no problem for a couple of years - I've met people with III's  that are using less than 1k... a year after they get it: they've seen &amp;  use very few aftermarket programs. However, I've got more programs in there  than will fit: launcher, datebook, calc &amp; memo replacements, travel  programs, doc reader, picture viewer, several clocks, a dozen utility and  security programs, over a dozen Hackmaster hacks, and a few games. Since  FlashPro gave me the extra 800k memory room (awesome), I found I probably  had enough that I could otherwise get by fine without deleting rarely-used  fluff programs - except that I use it heavily for work &amp; software  evaluation. The memory room of the Vx would be heaven - the perfect device,  I think. It'd be handy to carry a lot of maps, but my current standard P5  doesn't have the memory room without deleting, say, my picture viewer. (Oh,  the screen? It's great! Yes folks, it IS a 16 greyscale display!) Probably  I'll upgrade to the Vx &amp; give my wife my standard V (P5) unit: she  thought it was no big deal when I got it, but has fallen in love with the  capabilities and wants her own Palm device. Bottom line is that if you're a  minimalist, the 2k of P5 memory is fine. But if you like to carry a  Gerber/Leatherman/Swiss-Army device (like I do) because a pocketknife  leaves you unprepared... better get a Vx or get the 8mb upgrade on your  P5.Price? When Handspring comes out with something to compete with a Vx,  the price world will probably be great. Yeh, P5's are expensive compared to  some of the lesser PDA's - but compare the price to a palmtop computer, and  they look like a great deal... especially considering the impact on your  lifestyle.Can I mention my essential add-on programs list? Tough area,  but currently I wouldn't give up these - listed in order of descending  requirement: UnDupe (get it!), TealScript, Travel Clock, Hackmaster,  (SwitchHack, StayOffHack, PalmV hack, Invert Hack &amp; Invert, FindHack,  CatHack), DateBK3 (&amp; dbScan), BackupBuddy, IDPalm, FlashPro, a good  launcher - either Commander or LaunchEm have too many great enhancements to  do without. Must-have accessories: WriteRight screen covers, Throttle  Stylus/pen. I regard the PalmV hack and StayOff hack as absolute essentials  for Palm V users, and Invert with InvertHack give proper screen display  when the backlight's on.  In-depth info?

Palm V is an excellent device and it is a great buy for the sake of the technology's first step.But, after using it for about a year now, I am being selfish. I want more memory, I want color, I want sound and I want a floating connection to the rest of the world. So, my advice - when you buy a PDA, go for something with at least color and more memory (for the sake of technology's next step). You are going to run out of the Palm V's 2MB if you are like me and like to download all those available applications. Palm Vx has 8MB memory which should be enough for the time being, but I want more (Sorry !).I am looking at the PDA to be the materialisation of Isaac Asimov's vision of a hand held device which is carried by everyone in the world and has a unique identification number. So if you want to talk to your sister, just punch in her id number and there she is on the screen looking at you and yelling at you for buzzing her when she was in the shower !! Our privacy is going to be under fire, but it is going to be fun all the same. Asimov said that by 2010, this will be a reality. And, the world is fast getting there.

It does everything that you'd want it to do, does it well, and does it  quickly.  Plus the ability to sync the Palm V with your computer's PIM  (inc. Microsoft Outlook) makes importing and exporting contacts a  breeze.If you're not sure about the Graffiti writing system, I can tell  you that it's a very easy to learn.  Five minutes worth of practicing and  you'll have it down (it's very, very close to the normal alphabet).  After  a few days you'll have it completely memorized (the Palm folks also include  a handy &quot;cheat sheet&quot; sticker that you can stick to the inside of  the cover that's included with the Palm V).As someone who bought an  Apple Newton MessagePad (and lived though that debacle) I can say from  experience that the Palm is not a product that only a geek can love.  Anyone who is busy and wants to be able to keep track of contacts and  appointments will find this device invaluable and I sincerely mean that.  Once you have one you will not want to be without it, and it sure beats  hauling a fat old paper based organizer around.Some quick notes; the  Palm V Hard Case rocks!  If you travel a lot make sure to get one.  It  keeps the Palm V completely safe from harm and looks beautiful.  Also, with  the upgrade to Palm OS 3.3, you'll be able to sync your Palm with any  laptop with an infrared port without the need for any cables.

I chose the Palm V  over the other Palms, and over any Windows-based system because of the  sliim profile. I can put it in the front pocket of my slacks and it is not  obtrusive. The usefulness of the built-in functions for keeping to-do  lists, addresses, and calendars is obvious.  Less obvious is using all the  downloadable software available on the internet--Often for free, but more  often at a modest price, at least for the really useful stuff. I use the  calendar book function in a way I suspect the designers didn't intend--I  enter reminders to myself for a set date and time, so my alarm will go off  and the Palm will display a message such as &quot;Call Norman now.&quot;  I  also find the Search function very useful.  If I remember that I dealt with  Norman, but have forgotten his phone number or last name, I can have the  Palm search for &quot;Norman&quot; and display his name and address  (assuming I entered it when I first talked to him) as well as any notes or  memos I wrote about our discussion. You can do this for any word or name,  so if I remember discussing widgets with a guy, but have forgotten his name  or phone or company, I can search for &quot;widgets&quot; and again  everything I've entered on the subject will be available.

Moncure", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "Memorex is a brand name that does offer excellent product support, and certainly this product is excellent for two reasons. First, because it's easy to use. Cover art from CD's that have missing artwork can be relatively easily dropped into the blank template software provided at the Memorex website, and you can create cover art that functionally replaces the missing original artwork inside the jewel cases for your CD collection. Where it gets tricky - if darn near impossible - is creating the rear front insert printing. But if you're looking to put a cover and a tray insert in quick and fast this is the product.The instructions for creating cover art that looks decent or retail-presentable is very spare if not available at all. Part of the reason for this is that 99% of all retail CD cover art and jewel case inserts are printed on glossy paper and not the type of paper that ships with this product. The Maxell product, however, is on matte paper. This requires attention to detail when selecting inkjet printer settings, as you want to use the amount of ink that is usually dispersed for, say, a matte greeting card. If you use the incorrect setting, you can often spoil the insert by using entirely too much ink and creating a \"wavy\" effect in the art that will doom your intentionally perfect effort to the waste bin. So do a few test runs before you make a final copy - or at least expect you'll use 4-5 to get used to the product if it's the first time you're making cover art.The format of the pre-printed and pre-perforated sheet is excellent, however. But there are some bits of advice worth considering when removing the cover art. As the manufacturer indicates, you will want to fold along the seams that need to be torn in order to get a somewhat clean cut from the 8.5\" x 11\" sheet. You won't get the seamless cut you get, say, from Avery business card stock of the premium variety, but you'll get an acceptably clean cut if you follow this rule.Also be careful not to tear the perforations on the rear art that are meant to be where the folds are. I did this on the first sheet and had to repeat!The software enables you to line up the different edges of the original cover art to the template itself - but as with anything on a printer, make sure your printer is lined up correctly with the paper so you don't have any overlap. My advice is to slightly oversize the original art (easy to do if you have a basic understanding of image editing software) so that you can be sure you have a complete piece of art without white edges on top, bottom, or either side. It takes some tweaking - it's not as simple as just dragging, dropping, and printing.All that said, this product is more than adequate - software and inserts - for making gift mix CD's. The intuitive software guides you through the processes of creating cover art with either custom or stock image backgrounds, and placing track lists on your inserts. In fact the software is so useful, I am considering the use of the software with my own sheets sourced from another paper supplier, and then cutting the art myself from standard sheet stock.In short this product is adequate for replacement of cover art of value-priced CD's to be sold at retail, or to give a faceless CD a new jewel case home for your personal collection. But if you're looking for perfection in recreating major record label quality cover art, then look elsewhere. Alternatively if you are making your own CD's to be jewel cased as gifts or to create DVD ROM cover art for custom projects - business or personal - this would be an excellent product. For example creating a professional portfolio or storage cases for personal media would be two excellent uses for this product. Since I have almost one hundred of these sheets, I'll work my way through them. But because I have customers who demand near-retail-new perfection in their purchases, I am going to have to begin a thorough search for a product that maintains more of that specific aesthetic.On value and price this is an excellent product - certainly much cheaper than the retail locations where I had seen them locally. And again if you're using these for personal data storage, home-made products, or whatnot, these are excellent. That said they provide an exacting and demanding customer an ersatz product, that, if printed on a low DPI printer, can appear even - dare I say - kitschy.But with Amazon Prime offers and excellent delivery, I'm not throwing stones at retailers - just letting consumers know that if you're looking for what I was looking for - replacement cover art with the aesthetic of that of the major record labels, you'll need to do a little more digging out on the market for a good fit.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Another Ersatz Insert Replacement - But Good for Custom CD's / Gifts", "unixReviewTime": 1331942400, "reviewTime": "03 17, 2012"}

Unlike some hubs where two jacks are wired together, this design prevents accidentally shorting a station to an uplink.-  Screw-mount notches on the underside allows for easy attachment to the wall, underside of a counter, etc.If you want to set up a network without spending much, these hubs work well.  However, I suggest you buy a 10/100 Mbps hub instead.Here's why:Practically all new networkable devices today support 100 Mbps (FastEthernet) as well as 10 Mbps (Ethernet).  The EN-104 hub (and other 10 Mbps hubs) will limit you to the slower speed.As 10/100 Mbps hubs are readily available today, and are quite affordable, I think your money is better spent on the faster hub.Is there a noticeable difference between 10 Mbps and 100 Mbps?  It depends on your usage, but if you regularly work with files larger than about 300 KBytes or larger, you'll notice a tangible difference.  For truly large files (like graphics/movies, or when installing an application via a network drive), a 10 second transfer at 100 Mbps will take well over a minute at 10 Mbps.If the NetGear 10/100 hub (DS-104) is a bit too pricey for you, you might consider the Linksys EFAH05W 10/100 hub.

This particular computer is a business-class desktop, designed more for the office environment rather than the typical entertainment PC that we would normally have at home.  I decided to add DVD capability to this system, in order to enjoy a movie at my work desk whenever the mood strikes me to take a break from work (which happens quite frequently).

This is a very good Soundcard for its intended purpose.  Which is to provide basic sound functionality to a desktop computer.  The sound quality is good enough to enjoy listening to stereo sounds from music CDs and DVDs.  But please, do not expect this card to provide you with theatre-like surround sound quality.  This is definitely the wrong price range if you need that kind of quality.I compared the sound quality of this office system to my primary home system.

If you leave your glasses on it just doesn't work very well.  On the other hand, you are allowed to adjust each  eyepiece separate if you're like me and don't see 20/20.  However, there is a trick to it because you can only adjust individual focus on the right eyepiece.  So you cover the right eyepiece and focus the binoculars, then cover the left side to fine-tune the focus for your right eye. I found it a bit counter-intuitive, and think it would be better if you could separately adjust the focus on each side.  Even so, once you have it dialed in, there are marks on the frame and the eyepiece that you can use as reference for when it gets borrowed or changed inadvertently.My biggest issue with these binoculars is that they won't focus in close enough.  The target has to be close to 100' away.  Since they're high-powered binoculars, that's probably ok for most uses.  But I spend a lot of time watching birds 20' from my window.

I had owned Bushnell binoculars in the past and was very happy with them.These arrived totally broken.The left main lens housing was sheared completely off from the unit.Looking at them, I found they were constructed using cheap plastic for the main body. The lens housings are screwed into the body, but the plastic is so fragile that apparently when they were dropped sometime during the shipping process the plastic shattered.I probably could have Super-glued the housing back on but then they would have been subject to fogging since when the housing broke off the Nitrogen that is injected into the housing escaped. Nitrogen is used to prevent the lenses from fogging.While checking out the remainder of the unit, I worked with the quick focus lever and found that it didn't hold focus very well either. I would like to see a unit that has a dial focus with a lever fine focus so that the major focus point is stable. The lever focus would be really nice for finer focusing after you have zeroed in on the subject. I would have used them for viewing auto racing for the most part, so once you get the major focus point clear, a lever focus for fine focusing would be great for viewing a moving target like race cars that can vary in distance by up to 1/4 of a mile closer or further than the main focus point as the cars travel around the track. That is where the quick focus lever could do a great job. But to use it for the entire focus field is too much and it isn't fine enough since a tiny bump in the wrong direction can cause you to lose sight of your target object entirely.I also agree that the design of the focus bar is poor in that you have to use both hands to focus since you can only push down. Either that or if you have a long finger you can reach across the center and push down on the other side of the bar as well.I won't be reordering a replacement. Instead I will look for binoculars that have a more durable housing since using binoculars subjects them to being \"knocked around\" and if the material used by Bushnell shatters so easily, they are not going to last very long.So my advice to anyone who owns these particular binoculars is to protect them from being dropped or even bumped into trees, etc very hard since the housing is brittle and will shatter. If you use them in Winter, they will be even more brittle and the housing will shatter even more easily than in warm weather like we have now.I would also advise Bushnell to change their packaging since if they make a product that is this fragile they should pack it in thicker shock absorbing materials than they currently do since what they use wouldn't protect a product a fraction of the weight and bulk of this product. That would lessen the chance of catastrophic damage such as these were obviously subjected to.My cell phone, which weighs 3.5 ounces came in a corrugated box with a total weight of one pound with 10 ounces of that being the box and packing materials (the charger weighs about 2 oz).Yet these binoculars that weigh 12 TIMES as much as my cell phone, with optics that are far more vulnerable to damage from the shocks of shipping and handling than a cell phone have only a couple of ounces of material to protect them from damage and came in a box no sturdier than a cereal box.

Completely pointless (unusable in my opinion), and the first thing I would advise is to go buy the strap/support system of your choice and don't relay on the nasty accessory that comes with.The binoculars come with lens caps on. I haven't figure out if they intend you to use them all the time to protect the lenses, or if they're just for show in the box. The large caps are fine, but the small ones do not stay attached, so don't rely on them to protect.In use, the quick focus mechanism is actually very effective but definitely requires two hands to operate as it's a little stiff (and as a lever, you have to be able to press down on either side). I guess few people would be operating something this heavy with one hand, but it does mean that both hands are under tension as you have to have fingers on the  focus mechanism.Optically, these are absolutely built to the price.

The items viewed have a really nice 3-dimensional look to them and the diopter comes in handy even for someone with very bad vision like myself.  The focus for this model (16 x 50 Wide Angle) is a flat tab between the barrels that makes it VERY convenient to use without having to look or stretch your fingers.  It gives a very nice field of vision and has roll down eye cups, which is good just in case you want to wear your glasses or shades.  The binoculars do shake a little b/c of the power of the magnification.  And it can be a chore to hold for long periods of time b/c of its weight.  It weighs about as much as one of Michener's hardback novels.Here is where it can get interesting.  The binoculars come with a pleather carrying case, a really cheap neck strap that looks like a plastic shoelace, and a cheap cleaning cloth that is way too abrasive to be used everyday.  I suggest replacing both the neck strap and cleaning cloth as soon as you can.  The soft, microfiber cloths they sell in eyeglass stores works great.  Plus, pick up some of the eyeglass cleaner (spray directly onto cloth, not lens) as it really gets the lens clean and protects any coating on the glass.Tripod use:  highly recommended to get a steady picture.

A decent traditional wheel for focusing is superior.  You can't easily get a good focus, pressing your eyes against the eyepiece can force them out of focus, and it's easy to bump the rocker bar.  At 16x power, you have to carefully adjust focus and a rocker bar is an awful design.  You have to use both hands to focus: you can press down on one side of the rocker bar, but not up, so to go in and out of focus to get good sharpness, you have to press down with one hand's finger and then press down with the other hand's finger.  The rocker bar is terrible idea, especially for 16x!  To make matter's worse, there is a fair amount of play in the rocker bar.  The rocker bar seems to be the limiting factor on short distances. 40 feet seemed to be the shortest distance they would focus.  Stars come into focus well before the limit of the long-distance focus is reached, possibly indicating questionable workmanship, or maybe it makes it better for those who are really-bad near-sighted.The moons of jupiter were clear and sharp even under city lights.

They are rubber armored and seem fairly sturdy.  I live on the 9th floor near the beach.  These are great for watching moving boats and jetskis go by through my living room window.  They are good for a quick look at something, but difficult to hold steady for more than 30 seconds.  I guess that's the same for all 16x binoculars.  They work better with a tripod mount and a tripod.  These are probably easier to hold steady than 20x50's.  The Zip focus is handy.  The focus at 16x magnification is more critical than 8x or 10x binoculars.  I find myself re-focusing very frequently.  Kind of a pain after using my other Bushnell 8x25 Permafocus binoculars, which NEVER need to be refocused.  I got these for stargazing.  They don't work as well as expected for that purpose.  First, the BAK7 prisms don't transmit light as well as BAK4 prisms.  Second, the 50mm objective lens is not large enough for 16x magnification at night.  I also own a pair of Pentax Whitetails 10x50's which are much better for stargazing.  The Whitetails are much easier to hold steady and the image is much brighter at night.  The Whitetails are slightly heavier though.  The Celestron 15x70's are probably a better choice for stargazing if you want high magnification.  I thought about returning the Bushnell 16x50's because they aren't so good at night.  I gave them a second chance today and decided to keep them for daytime use.  Not bad as a spare pair to have around with higher magnification than 8x or 10x, but I don't recommend them as your first or only pair of binoculars though.As for magnification, 7x and 8x binos are fairly easy to hold steady.  10x approaches the limit of steadyness for handheld use.  I used to have a pair of Tasco 12x50's and tried to use them for stargazing.  I had to prop my elbows on a car hood to use them.  Even then, they were not very steady.  I loaned them to a friend for a football game once, and I never saw them again.  No great loss really.  16x is really pushing the limit for shakeyness.  There's no way I'd buy 20x binoculars for handheld use.  8x seems to be the best compromise between steadyness and magnification.  For stargazing, many authors recommend 7x50 binoculars.  Personally, I don't think 7x magnification is good enough.  You'll want something with higher magnification after trying them.  You can't really go wrong with a pair of 10x50's for stargazing, like the 'Pentax' Whitetails I mentioned before.  The 10x50's might even be cheaper for the same optical quality as 7x50's.  A pair of 8x56's or 9x63's would be good for stargazing too, but the 10x50's are more bang for the buck.  If you've never owned a pair of binoculars before, and you want some good ones for daytime use, you can't really go wrong with a good pair of 8x40's.  I like the 8x40's better than 7x35's, because 7x is not high enough magnification.

Tho they're high power (16) for the objective lens diameter (50), the exit pupil size gave me no trouble. . .It may have been in double vision but it was easy to get the full view, at least on a bright day.There are complaints in the reviews about the Lever focus mechanism, versus a focus wheel.  The little that I used the binoculars, I didn't have a problem with the lever focus.  In fact, focusing by rocking the lever with a finger on each side was kind of nice.  The lever mechanism seems like a promising idea but apparently whether Bushnell executed it effectively is in question.  And I suppose it's possible the lever mechanism had something to do with the unequal focus between barrels and apparent soft-focus but given my pair's other huge problems, it was impossible to tell.The reviews complaining of the too-wide interpupillary adjustment are SPOT-ON.  I'm male of average height.  My eyes aren't particularly close together but my binoculars at their narrowest interpupillary distance were barely narrow enough for me.  I've never before had that trouble with binoculars.  These binoculars would be useless for lots and lots of people.Otherwise the binoculars seemed solid and durable.My main problem wasn't with the binoculars but with Amazon Warehouse Deals, where I bought them.  There's no reason binoculars this defective should have been relisted and sold to me...It's plain bad business and bad customer service. Anyone considering buying binoculars from Warehouse Deals should do it with eyes wide open for lemons.  Luckily they're pretty easy about returns and letting you try again. A keeper arrives eventually.Of course I'll return them.  I'm ambivalent about trying another pair of 16x50 Powerviews.  The complaints about the focus lever and interpupillary adjustment had me on the fence to begin with.  Then I get this pair that's so miserably out-of-whack. . .It might be a fluke or it might be the Powerview design ??If you're looking at Powerviews, consider Bushnell H2O; I have a pair of 8x42 H2O's.  For about the same price the H2O's are waterproof & more solid and come with a wheel focus and better twist-up, rather than fold-up, eyecups.  However, H2O's don't have the attractive selection of high powers and big objectives.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Lack of narrow interpupillary range could be a problem - think about Bushnell H2O's instead", "unixReviewTime": 1394755200, "reviewTime": "03 14, 2014"}

It was my first exposure to MP3, as up to that point I had been dismissing it as a fad.  Having the device, and about 150 CD's, I figured why not give it a shot.The installation of the software went smooth.  I found an update, and installed that as well with no problems.  Then I started trying to rip and found that the included software was hardly stable.  I was running on Windows NT, which seemed to be supported by the manufacturer, but with some caveats.  I would start ripping and the software would crash.  I would try to transfer to the device and the software would crash.  I would complete a transfer to the device after several tries only to find that one or more songs didn't actually make it.  Bottom line - the connectivity for this device was pathetic.But speaking for the device itself - I loved it.  The music played cleanly, without interruption, regardless of how much I shook the device.  The buttons on the front are well placed, well labeled, and nicely inset just enough so they still provide easy access, but you don't have to worry about them protruding.  It has all the features you might want including random and repeat.  The display let's me know how much memory I have, what track number is playing, and the time of the song.  There are also various other indicators that are helpfull (battery, etc.).The memory on this device is small - 32Mb.  And the manufacturer says it will only support up to 64Mb total with an expansion card.  That expansion card can hold it's own set of music so you can swap them in and out without effecting the music on the built in memory.  However, vendor chose the odd memory type of 3.3V for the external memory versus typical CompactFlash.There's a convenient &quot;lock&quot; switch on the side that keeps the buttons from registering.  This can be good in two ways: it won't get turned on accidentally and burn battery, and you won't accidentally hit the stop button and interrupt your listening.  The belt clip is handy, and detachable, and the battery life (one AA) is quite respectable.In all, I really love my Rio PMP 300.  It's perfect for a trip to the gym, a jog around the neighborhood, or even for a short plane flight.  If all you need is an hour (30 mins on internal memory alone at a 128 sample rate) to pass the time, then you really don't need to spend more - this is the perfect device.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great little device for short duration play", "unixReviewTime": 995587200, "reviewTime": "07 20, 2001"}

Unlike the Creative Labs set that is configured more like a standard set of stereo speakers, allowing you to position your satellites anywhere in the room to achieve optimal separation, the Altec Lansing set has very short cables.  The left speaker has to be within four feet of the subwoofer.  Then the right speaker has to be within six feet of the left.  Then to add insult to injury, the five foot wire from the computer to the speaker system has to plug into the left speaker.Worst of all, they hard-wire everything.  On the Creative labs system, the computer connects to the subwoofer which connects via standard speaker cable to the satellites.  Wonderful and simple design!!  The Altec Lansings have wires of non-standard configuration hard-wired into the left speaker and chincy speaker wire that is hard-wired between the speakers (Maybe if you rip them apart and splice wires you could expand it, but do you want to?).The easy configuration of your computer speaker system is a large percentage of its sound and convenience.

If you're looking for subwoofered sound on the cheap, this is probably your best bet.  They're competent performers, without taking price into consideration.  Look at how much they cost, and you'll think there aren't better speakers made on the planet.  They have the potential to work, as do most speakers, on both Macintosh and Windows machines.Interestingly, they also have a secondary use.  Because they don't need a computer to work at all, they can be plugged directly into any stereo system that has the ability to output its sound (that is, one which has an AUDIO OUT jack).  They can thus give resonant stereo sound--even to lowly portables.  You'll think twice about whether you really need to upgrade to a whole new system after hearing these speakers.  (Before buying for this purpose, however, I'd recommend you go to altec-lansing.com and grab the manual for this product, just to make sure that it's compatible with your stereo.)Inasmuch as there are drawbacks to the speakers, they are ones you would expect from a product so inexpensive.  As another reviewer has rightly pointed out, there's no volume control on the woofer.  There's also no bass, treble, or speaker-independent volume control.  And the speakers are rated at only 10 watts, with a relatively indelicate frequency response.But, big deal.If, like most people, you've got your computer jammed into a corner in a busy room, you don't have the soundspace to set up a truly extraordinary auditory experience.  If you've got a lot of people living with you, anything more than 10 watts is discourteous, anyway.  Unless you have a room that you can dedicate to the computer, and that's relatively isolated from others, it's extremely unlikely you would actually be able to use more than this system offers.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Doubtful most users need more than this", "unixReviewTime": 977961600, "reviewTime": "12 28, 2000"}

I have owned mine for over 2 years now and I sit at my home office desk many hours a day talking into it.There are many more elaborate and MUCH more expensive items out there but my question is, why? Why would you spend 60 or 50 or even 20 dollars on something when this 10 dollar headset works as well as it does. I have never had anyone complain that my voice was weak or that I sounded odd when using this unit. In fact, I don't think anyone can ever tell I'm on a headset. I can hear the caller crystal clear and the noise cancelling mic delivers as it was meant to.In my opinion, manufacturers do not always put as much effort in the headset jack section of phones they do not expect to be used in an office setting. This is not to say ALL office or multi-unit phones are exceptional. Some of these are weak in this respect. With simple home phones, doubly so.My Motorola SOHO set has an excellent jack section. I mention this because this will have a huge impact on your experience with this or any headset.One huge problem for me with wired headsets has always been, when walking around with the unit on, I get the cord caught on doorknobs and various hazzards around the home/office. When this happens, it rips the phone off of your ear and has destroyed more than one more expensive unit. Hence, the willingness to try this less expensive unit. Funny thing is, although I've managed to rip this thing off several times, I don't seem to have damaged it in any way. It has outlasted every single headset I have ever owned. And it works and sounds as great now as it did the day I got it.I bought this thing figuring if it worked but only lasted 8 or 10 months, I could just buy another one and save some money going this route.

People who do computer-aided design and need fine cursor control absolutely love the FX because the large ball gives you just that - better fine control than any other mouse or trackball.  However, some actions, like drag and drop, are difficult to do with the traditional left button and ball, and instead require the use of the 3rd button as a drag lock, which is easy to do, but different than you may be used to -- once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature.  The fourth button can be programmed for scrolling.  The buttons are programmable - you can choose what function you want them to perform.The hand placement over the curvaceous FX body is also very comfortable and even relaxing - once you get used to it, and don't try to drag and drop with the left button and ball.  You can use both your thumb and one or even two or three fingers to move the ball around without ever tiring or straining.The downside of this model is that Logitech has abandoned it due to a patent infringement suit, and no parts are available for repairs, and no one I know repairs them.  To get a part, you must cannibalize another Trackman Marble FX, and the cannibalized parts will already be used and aged with a short life span -- assuming you can get a used one with still usable components.  There are no new FX's anywhere.Another downside is that the FX only came with either a serial port or a PS/2 connector.  There are no USB or wireless versions.  And every attempt to utilize a USB adapter results in some functionality being lost.  The serial port has long gone the way of the Dodo bird, and PS/2 ports are non-existent on new model computers.  In another 5 years the FX will be largely obsolete and incompatible.  This has already affected the going price.  Whereas a couple of years ago, even a poor-condition FX commanded a steep price, a mint-condition FX now command less than $100 (I won my minty for only $82 just yesterday as I write this). Yes, there are vendors still listing FX's near $300, but they aren't getting many takers, if any.The bottom line for this once very superior design is that apart from a few fanatics (like myself) who have yet to upgrade to a new USB-only PC (or Mac) the FX is dated, and soon will be obsolete and incompatible with the new equipment coming out.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Once superior design now dated and headed for obselesence", "unixReviewTime": 1284681600, "reviewTime": "09 17, 2010"}

Now  having used the FX Trackman at home and at work for over 3 years, I find  that it is the still the best input device of its kind, including the new  MSFT optical mice. Once one gets used to the button placement and develops  the dexterity to utilise the trackball, constantly smooth and consistent  movement will reward them. With no moving parts for the tracking assembly  the user only rarely [once a year?] has to pop the ball out and clean the  sensors.

The product I bought is actually the Cordless version of the FX Trackball, but it's basically the same as this one except for the cordless/wireless feature. The ergonomics are a little different also but it's basically the same trackball device.You can't beat the smoothness of this trackball. I've seen lots of them over the years but none ever impressed me enough to buy one until now. Now that I've tried one I'm a convert. The action is extremely smooth once you adapt a little to the finger movements to move the ball. Also, getting used to the placement of the four different buttons takes a little time. But once this is accomplished the ability to move smoothly and quickly around your computer screen is vastly improved over a typical mouse.The buttons are all configurable as to function, but I've found sticking with the default settings during the software setup is the best way to go. There is one thing I am trying to see how it works out. I reconfigured button 4 as the delete key. This is sort of convenient because it allows you to browse and delete files just with the  trackball instead of having to use the other hand to hit the delete key on the keyboard after highlighting a file with the trackball. Pretty convenient for those occasional cleanup tasks on your hard disk.Another thing I have found useful is to use medium instead of low acceleration, which allows you to shoot all the way across the screen by moving the trackball maybe an inch and a half or so, but then to drop the overall sensitivity down a bit. The default setting for trackball sensitivity is right in the middle of the range on the slider adjustment bar. I drop it down one more tack on the slider bar. This assists in hitting all those small buttons when using high resolution on your monitor. The medium acceleration gets you there faster but then you have more control once you're there to zero in on the button. Try it and see if you like this better than the default settings. You will find these settings by opening up the Trackball program menu, clicking on &quot;mouse properties,&quot; and then on the &quot;motion&quot; tab.One last thing I do to customize the operation of the trackball is you can check a box that causes the cursor to jump to the highlighted button of a new dialog box. I find this useful also.I noted a very interesting new feature. One of the buttons when clicked pops up the &quot;Webwheel.&quot; This is a wheel with 10 different pie-shaped pieces which are configurable as web addresses or for other web-related functions, such as go back, reload, go to favorites/bookmarks, and so on. When you hit this button, the wheel comes up, and you basically have a second menu to choose selection from. Pretty cool.I should mention the software install is a little non-intuitive. The instructions say to disconnect your mouse and plug in the new trackball (with the power off). However, when you boot the machine, Windows 98 sees the now missing mouse and wants to autodetect your hardware again and recreate the entire driver database. Not knowing what would happen I just cancelled out of this screen and let the computer boot up normally but without any mouse function. I then loaded the software, using the tab key to navigate around to configure everything, which wasn't too hard, and after you are finished it asks do you want to reboot, and after that the trackball works normally.Although not cheap, all in all a fine product that is worth the money.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Made me a convert", "unixReviewTime": 984355200, "reviewTime": "03 12, 2001"}

The ease of use and its inconspicuousness make it an invaluable addition to the Talk Abouts, but there is room for improvement.  My biggest complaint is that the TA280/289 don't allow for the alert tone (call tones / menu tones / etc.) volumes to be regulated.  This makes for some very uncomfortably loud noise spikes with that earbud only an inch or so from your eardrum.  The TA280/289 DO allow the alert tones to be disabled, but that makes it a little more difficult to operate (especially when you have them tucked away under your outer clothing). My only other complaint was in the design of the PTT/MIC housing.  I would've preferred something a little easier to use with gloves on (the PTT button is 1/2&quot; from the MIC and pressing it with gloves on covers the MIC....).

And you can hear a HUGE difference too. The YB 400 does have a good speaker, clear and adequate for a radio its size, but it's not exceptional. I'd give the nod to the Kaito 1102. Since the Kaito 1102 is similarly sized and is fifty dollars cheaper than the YB400, I say it's a no brainer: Get the Kaito 1102.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent Radio with One Glaring Weakness", "unixReviewTime": 1097798400, "reviewTime": "10 15, 2004"}

This is also solved by synch detection.If  distance daytime AM listening is desired, the Sony with its fast AGC is  better than the YB400 with its slow AGC, because you can add a MW loop  (Select-a-tenna, Terk Loop, or Radio Shack MW loop) and tune it  successfully with a fast AGC.  It's difficult to tune with the YB400's slow  AGC, though sometimes you can turn the switch to local and disable the AGC  temporarily to do it.(Slow AGC gives you an edge in copying interfering  morse code stations, however, because the louder station won't modulate the  weaker one on the YB400, and it will on the Sony.)For strong stations,  pick the YB400 for the audio.

I was looking for CAT 5e cables to replace my older cables and decided based on the reviews on Amazon and the price that this would be a great purchase. I don't regret it. The cable is of good quality and the cables-as advertised-are completely snagless; so much so, that it'll take you a couple seconds longer to unplug the cord from whatever peripheral or computer it's hooked into. This was actually frustrating for me when I was troubleshooting my router, but then became a plus when I realized how easily the other cable would come undone with just moderate tension on the cord. So, the snagless is great if you plan on leaving it hooked into one device for any extended length of time, but not so great if you plan on constantly hooking and unhooking it from your device (in this case, it's probably more convenient to get a \"snagging\" one. Otherwise known as...a regular RJ45 cable). I can imagine someone with a laptop using a wired internet connection fussing over this feature.  Oh yeah, the length of this cord is a beautiful thing. I got so tired of having all this excess cord hanging out the back of my devices that I was thrilled when I discovered this on Amazon. I had no idea they made the lengths of the cord this short, so, that was actually the deciding factor for me.

Could be the shorter cord, could be better quality, I'm not really one to say since I'm no pro with these things, but it has improved my router's signal. One piece of advice, if you're using more than one get a different color. I wasn't thinking and prefer the blue cord, so I ended up with two blue cords that are going to the same product. Since I do occasionally plug my modem directly into the PC instead of through the router, I ended up having to color a black mark on the one cord so I know which is which. The snagless feature on these works really well and was the biggest concern I had with the cable that came with the router since I could already see the clip starting to wear from unplugging it and plugging.

They are very nice quality. They seem heftier than a lot of the other cables. My system analyst neighbor mentioned that he prefers to buy the 1000 foot roll. He runs them to wall outlets, then uses the 7 foot or 14 foot snap in cable from the wall to the PC. That way, you don't have to buy a 40 dollar crimping tool.You can't solder these cables. They require a metal to metal contact, and lead-solder doesn't qualify. Also, it is critical to keep them spiraled, all the way up to the end. Even when attaching, instructions call for twisting them right up to the connection.Since the tech instructions, tell you to keep them down to under 350 feet, these cables, whether they are long or short, are in the right lengths.I know Amazon doesn't print prices in their reviews, but they have the local major chain office supply stores beat hands down. The 50 foot roll was half again as much locally.These are the Category 5e cables. They give you a better return feed, which results in better overall performance. So insist on 5e instead of just 5. I initially bought some wall plates from Radio Shack that were Category 3, then I returned those for the snap in option Category 5. Those were returned also, when I went to Home Depot (of all places to go networking) and they had the complete Leviton line of 5e accessories.If I had to do it over again, I would still buy the Belkin 50 footers. I don't want to have a 500 foot roll of ethernet cable hanging around.These are tops. Gold plated connectors, Snag free ends, that protect that little lock in tab on the ends. You know the frustration of unsnarling a phone wire, out of a wiring mess, and the little tab bends over backwards, never to work properly again.

Consider this, some cheap non amplified speakers cost near $15 dollars and for double that price, you would expect about double the quality. Well, let me tell you, this baby more than quad-triples the sound of those speakers.The Creative labs PC WORKS 1000 system comes complete with the 2 satelitte cubes, the subwoofer, power adapter, audio inputer cable, mounting stands, velcro attachments and screws. Installation was very easy, just plug the speakers in the back of the sub, plug in the power adapter in the power source and the audio cable in the sub and the source.The included manual is quite small but is adequate enough to help you set up and get the system running. They have recommendations on placement and volume. I plugged my system into a discman first. When I first turned it on I was amazed at the power of the bass. The OOMPHS really shocked me.Concerning the volume, this is one of the problems I have with the system. First off, the volume is somewhat hard to find the appropriate setting. (There is a bass adjustmant on the sub and a volume control on the audio cable) Finding a balance in bass and treble is quite hard. When the bass level is at 50% (as set when you first get the system), the bass tends to overpower the treble at lower volumes while the treble overpowers the bass at high volumes. Solving this problems involves alot of tweaking and depends on the type of music you listen to.My second problem with this system is the supplied velcro strips. These were supposed to be used to mount to a wall. I was obviously skeptical at the concept but I tried it anyway. About 3 days after mounting them to the wall, on one of the speakers, the velcro pad unstuck from the speaker so the speaker fell. After re-sticking it, almost a day later, the velcro pad stuck to the wall unstuck so the other speaker fell. After this happened, it is obvious that the actual sticking surface which attaches to the wall/speaker is too weak, not the velcro. If you decide to use the velcro, let the pads stick to the surfaces for atleast 2 days before mounting the speaker to the wall.Those 2 problems are my only ones, other than that the volume is excellent. You will be suprised about the amount of volume you can get from this system. Its hard to explain,...hear the sound, you will be amazed.....In conclusion, if you think about it, the cost of these speakers warrant it to be a typical speaker system for any computer and can easily be used for a small home theatre system. The speakers are magnetically shielded so you can mount them to your monitor. If you got extra cash and you want neighbours 2 or 3 houses down the road to hear you, consider pumping out that cash for a more expensive system. But for regular people like me on a budget, this system is an excellent solution for any sound need.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Cheap but powerful speakers", "unixReviewTime": 990057600, "reviewTime": "05 17, 2001"}

If you want high end sound, completely distortion free at full volume, with a treble that can call in the dogs from a mile away and a bass that can rattle cracks in your house's foundation these are NOT the speakers for you.But if you don't want to spend a lot of money and you still want reasonable quality, these speakers are a good buy. Given the price of these speakers, I must say I was amazed at the sheer clarity of the sound. I tested them with my car CD player and they played everything from classical Beethoven to classic rock with alaming precision. They worked equally well on my computer for CDs, MP3s, and DVDs. The bass was separately adjustable--a plus at this price range--and the apparatus was easy to set up.I did not experience audible hiss that was noted by some of the reviewers, but at higher end of the volume setting the higher sounds tended to fray and the bass became a little muddy. No matter. This is not the speaker set up for a large room or a home theater. These are personal speakers that will function best in a small room or office and they pack more than enough punch for this venue.My five star rating reflects the quality of the product given its price.  I have listened to other speakers by Boston Acoustics, Altec Lansing, and Yamaha that were bought for almost double this price that did not sound as good as these.

Simply put, this compact computer speaker system is an absolute dynamo!! It consists of two 3-inch X 3-inch X 3-inch satellite cubes, a 9-inch X 6-inch X 6-inch subwoofer unit, and a wired remote volume control unit. The subwoofer is the central unit in the system. In addition to pumping out a deep, mellifluous, natural sounding bass into the room, it provides amplification for the satellites.It doesn't take  long at all to get the Cambridge SoundWorks PCWorks speaker system set up and running. Here's all you have to do:* Connect one of the volume controller's 6-foot leads to the computer's &quot;audio out&quot; port, and the other lead to the subwoofer.* Connect each satellite's 10-foot lead to the subwoofer.* Plug the subwoofer into household current.* As the instruction manual points out, the human ear can't distinguish the location of bass frequencies; so subwoofer placement is not critical. I suggest placing it on or near the floor on a low-lying shelf.  For best results, don't  place anything within 4 inches directly in front of the subwoofer.After setting up my Cambridge SoundWorks PCWorks speakers, I really put them through their paces.  I test drove them with music as diverse as Beethoven's &quot;Spring&quot; violin sonata and &quot;The Best of the Guess Who.&quot;  I played a variety of computer games.  And, I watched the movie &quot;Gladiator&quot; in my computer's DVD player.  In all cases, The sound from these little Cambridge SoundWorks PCWorks gems was simply magnificent... at all times, crisp, clear, well balanced, and natural.  Never  any distortion, fuzziness, or clipping, regardless of how loud I set the volume.I &quot;discovered&quot; Cambridge SoundWorks speaker systems a couple  years ago, when I bought an &quot;Ensemble IV&quot; satellite/subwoofer system for my stereo. When I first bought it, I was amazed at the sound quality that emanated from that miniature dynamo; two years later I'm still amazed.The Cambridge SoundWorks PCWorks is as good as my &quot;Ensemble IV&quot; system; in fact, I rate it as the best computer speaker system I've ever heard. Considering its very inexpensive price tag, it also a system that packs a huge &quot;bang for the buck&quot; for consumers.So, if you're looking for a new computer speaker system that will bring your games, music, and movies alive, look no farther that Cambridge SoundWorks PCWorks.

I thought that it would have been a good investment counsidering how small the styli are. Considering my penchant for misplacing things, particularly pens, i thought i should go ahead and get them. For some strange reason, I've only lost one in 6 months and that was the one that came with the unit. In that aspect one pack of these replacement stylus should last you a while.However if you can get other replacement styli that can fit the silo i suggest you go that way. The replacement styli dont seem to fit the silo as well as the original one. It doesnt fit right. After a little investigation i found that the plastic tip (the part that can unscrew) is slightly larger in circumference then the original stylus. Thats why it seems a little tight when you take the it out and put it back. Why this is, i have no clue but it's really annoying.For anything else you can get these babies to preserve the continuity of the unit, otherwise i recommend you find another replacement stylus that can fit the silo.Personally though i dont use the stylus. I recommend you go get one of those multi-pens that have a stylus, pen and pencil all in one. All serious Palm users use one of these instruments simply because any type of prolong use of the stock stylus will certainly give you cramps, at the very least. Its like writing with a toothpick. If you anticipate that your going to be scribling on your palm a lot go get a multipen. Cross makes a good one, Lamy and Rotring also makes excellent multipens. Personally i use a Rotring black matte Trio-pen. It carries a blue pen, stylus and pencil.

As an earlier reviewer pointed out, the software that comes with this product is very buggy and be prepared to spend some time troubleshooting to get it working.Here's my first experience. I use Windows 2000 on a PIII 550Mhz, with 256 RAM and 20 Gig EIDE harddrive. When Dazzle arrived, I followed the directions and installed the software and put the plug in the USB port and then discovered that this software only works with Windows 98. I visited the Dazzle web site and found out that you have to purchase a program called Movie Star is you want to use it with Windows 2000. I wound up ordering the software for [more $] plus shipping. Once, I received the new disk, I installed it, and once again, it did not detect the unit when I plugged it into the USB port. And again, I visited the Dazzle web site. I discovered that they have posted a patch for the Movie Star software that fixes &quot;some minor problems.&quot; I downloaded and installed the patch and after rebooting the machine, I was able to get it to detect the unit.The next step was to get Dazzle to work with my cheap... Mitsubishi VHS player. I was able to get it to work with the S-Video port from my Panasonic DV camcorder, but I couldn't get it to detect the output plugs from the VHS player. Finally after rebooting the machine twice, I got it to work.Next getting the software to work was another challange. despite having a fast machine with a lot of RAM, I found the Movie Star program to be very unstable. I was able to capture up to 60 minutes of video and save it to the MPEG format, but everytime I tried to edit or export the video as Windows Media or Real, it crashed the machine. I downloaded a copy of Ulead's Video Studio, but couldn't figure out how to import MPEG files. I finally bit the bullet and wound up downloading a free 30-day trial of Adobe Premier. I found Premier to be a very stable and easy to use program. I just wish it didn't cost [so much!]For my trouble, I found the output from Dazzle to be satisfactory. You would get better results if you spent big money for video capture card that would let you plug an S-Video cable into the back of your PC. Another better alternative would be to use Firewire. (I always use Firewire with my Panasonic DV camcorder and it works great.)After my experience, I cannot recommend this unit to others. I don't think it's fair that this company charges Windows 2000 users extra $.. for buggy software. And I think they could improve the USB connect so it isn't so difficult to use.

We were definitely not disappointed.After just a few days the  camera accompanied us to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and Seoul, S. Korea, while  we nervously left our Canon SLR at home.  The camera performed marvelously.  We found the optional 16MB flash memory card more than adequate for our  needs, as we easily downloaded photos each day into our laptop.We were  amazed at the quality of photos even in low light settings.  We took shots  at our conference including a multimedia presentation where surprisingly  the projected image on the screen was readable!  While staying in the  countryside in a traditional Mongolian &quot;ger&quot; (tent), we shot an  incredible photo of the predawn sky-- even the morning stars are clearly  distinguishable!Arriving home we were completely satisfied with the  photos shot at the low resolution setting when printed out on our HP  Deskjet 895 using an Epson photographic paper.  I doubt that most people  would be able to tell the difference between the prints and a standard  developed snapshot.  The enclosed Olympus and Adobe software is easy to use  and functional for most home use.  You will absolutely love the Quickstitch  utility that simply creates oversized and panorama shots!One of the only  weaknesses we found a little frustrating was the variance between the  optical viewfinder and the digital one.  If you frame... say, a head and  shoulders shot in the optical viewfinder, you will discover that digitally  the camera sees a much broader area.  Olympus should do a little better job  calibrating the two viewfinders.Apart from that, you will want to invest  in the NiMH charger and at least 8 batteries-- shop around for the best  price.  Also, picking up a 3.5 inch floppy adapter for the flash memory  card will be a big time saver. You simply pull out the flash memory card,  slip it into the adapter, and then slide the floppy into any computer.  You'll save time and frustration over having cords laying all around your  table, plus a significant download time.One last item-- Do you think a  16MB memory card will be too small for your needs?

I agree with many of them. You won't feel bad about spending your $$$. I've shopped around and I've made my decison with confidence. (Yes,  you can find this item for less at other e-stores, but I trust Amazon, they  deliver promptly and their Customer Service is great!)  Some customers have  said that this camera eats batteries like crazy. It's only true when you  use the LCD monitor to TAKE pictures. If you use it  for reviewing (and  deleting) the pictures you have taken, it lasts a long, long time. I have  purchased my camera before Thanksgiving. It's December 12, and after taking  hundreds of pictures (most using flash), I am STILL using the batteries it  came with!  Lemme tell ya a little secret, if you do take pictures using  the LCD monitor, and you get the message that the battery is low, turn off  the camera, let it rest for a little while and turn it back on again. The  battery life will show full again! No need to change the batteries until it  tells you it's dead and you have been taking pictures using the viewfinder.  Now, it is not a bad idea to get yourself some rechargeable NiMH batteries.  I've seen many good comments about the brand MAHA. Also, I have seen great  reviews on MAHA's charger model MH-C204F. Some people have mentioned them  here. But I didn't know where to purchase them from. So here you go. For  more info on the MAHA products, go to Maha-comm website. And to purchase  these two products, check out Thomas-distributing's website (sorry I can't  include the exact web addresses according to the reviews guidelines, but it  isn't hard to figure out). For around $50 I got the charger and 8 NiMH  batteries. Now you can go on the road and not worry about your batteries  dying or where to purchase them.  It's a lot of fun to have a digital  camera and take hundreds and hundreds of pictures knowing you don't have to  pay for developement or wait to finally see your pictures. Just download  them and enjoy or use the video cable to see your photos on your TV. Or  just use the LCD monitor! :)  -- From a happy Olympus/Amazon customer. :)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The D340R is a great camera!", "unixReviewTime": 944956800, "reviewTime": "12 12, 1999"}

When the dying battery crosses a certain voltage threshold, some devices warn you of a low battery.  This is a good thing, because you don't want, say, your smoke alarm to need to go onto backup battery power and not have the juice it needs.

I must admit, the information provided by Energizer with this charger doesn't help to understand the limitation of this 'fixed time' charger.It will put 430MilliAmps for 5 Hours into a AA NiMH. 430Ma times 5 Hours = 2100MaH.

Since there is always some existing charge left in rechargeables before recharging, if your NiMH AA's capacity is less than 2500Mah(typically yes for AA NiMH) they will be fully charged by this charger. Likewise, NiCad AAs less than about 1200MaH(typical for NiCads) your batteries will be fully charged.You can use the information above and the charging currents given on the Spec Sheet for this charger to figure charging capacities for other size and capacity batteries. C and D size capacities greater than 30000MaH will not be fully charged in one 5 hour cycle and will have to be cycled twice(2 X 3000Mah = 6000Mah)or more times, unless left in the charger to trickle charge for a long period of time(a good idea in any case to top off all charges). Every 24 hours of 65ma trickle current will add another 325MaH charge to a C or D cell till it reaches its full rated Mah capacity. Trickle charging batteries by leaving them in the charger after the 'timed' charge cycle (5 hours on 'NiMH' setting, 3 hours on 'NiCad') will keep your batteries topped off to full capacity at all times without hurting them.So, this charger is a good value if you understand what it does and and does not do. Those with less knowledge or time, but more money, may want to buy the more expensive Smart Chargers others have mentioned here. The Vanson would be my choice, a very good value. I have derated this charger because of lack of information provided to the consumer by Energizer on its site and on its Spec Sheet for this charger. They're not alone in this department, but there is still no excuse for this.If you really don't need a Universal(all battery types charged) then you can get a Smart AA/AAA combination charger for much less. I would recommend the RipVan Lighting 4000N at RipVan100.Com. It charges fast but gently(doesn't over-heat batteries, a life killer).Hope this has helped everyone. Rechargeables are the only way to go for saving you gobs of money and the environment gobs of abuse. Buy good high capacity rechargeables, like highly rated Energizer's, and buy a good charger that will treat them right for you.

I didn't expect Manfrotto carbon-fiber quality, but the head is a bit disappointing.  The quick-release plate is somewhat fussy to get onto a camera and into the head.If you're going to mount a still camera and leave it stationary indoors, this unit should work passably, but beware if you're going to use it with a video camera:  mine doesn't pan smoothly and wobbles quite a bit when using any controls on my Canon HG21 or the Rode SVM mounted on top, or when people walk around nearby.  This leads to shaky video, even with in-camera IS, which in turn works against the compressibility of the resultant files.  The tilt hinge is something of a disappointment, as with a still camera in landscape orientation, when fully closed the camera is slightly tilted.If one's needs are very occasional and don't require panning or much adjustment, this could be a reasonable buy.

I had one problem and discovered the write protection slide tab was open. Sabrent's latest manual SFT-USDB_NewManual.pdf, from their website, explains that the write protection tab must not be open (so you can see through it -- for those of you that have not been through the glorious 3.5 floppy era) for the drive to function correctly. Also, I tried several techniques to get some floppies to work correctly -- right clicked on folder and selected Open, ejected and replugged the drive without the floppy in it, and several verbal invectives. Most of my photos, program data files and old program installation files seemed to copy easily, albeit slowly, onto the hard drives. Overall, a good bargain compared to the hassle of trying to install a 3.5 floppy into the computer that wasn't designed to accept such an installation.

It had repeatedly failed to read ANY floppy. The only other problem I've encountered (in only 1 hour of testing) is that the device driver (written by Microsoft) hung on one occasion, requiring a reboot to resolve.I would also note that the User Manual available online is for a Teac drive while the drive they sent me is a Mitsumi drive.

If anyone's disappointed with the quality of the video (see reviews below), they are probably being  unrealistic in their expectations. To get better video, you'd have to go up  to a 3CCD camera (at about 3times the cost!). As for those who say that the  camera is too big and heavy, I say just TRY shooting a still video without  a tripod with a camera as small as a paperback book! You NEED something  larger to get a good steady picture (even with &quot;steadyshot&quot;). I  appreciate Sony's innovative digital 8 because the tapes are less  expensive, but you still have the quality of digital recording (the Pauses  are terrific!). I'm not worried that these tapes are not interchangeable  with the mini-DV format. I mean, how often would I want to trade digital  tapes with someone? I also have the option of playing back any old 8 or  hi-8 videotapes that were previously recorded, and converting them to  digital (try THAT with a mini-DV camcorder)! I like having A/V outputs AND  inputs so that I can digitally record from a source other than the camera  lens. The Sony infrared &quot;nightshot&quot; is astounding. It's like have  nightvision goggles for your camcorder! The LCD screen on the TRV310 is  WONDERFUL... 3.5 inches! The 20X optical zoom is sufficient, and going  partway into the digital zoom ain't too bad either (as long as you don't  try to actually use the full 360X!) I cannot say enough good things at this  point. If I have to find something negative to say, I wish some of the  controls were in easier locations to get to while I'm still filming.

In some cases I might think the color is a bit undersaturated, but I prefer this to seeing colors pushed beyond what they should be.  I have no complaints about the sharpness of the video.  In very low light the picture doers become grainy; I suspect that new camcorders out there may do a better job in low light than the TRV310.One thing I really like about this camcorder today is that it seems better built than the Digital8 models than Sony is currently producing.  In addition, the lens is a bit larger on the early Digital8 models, so low light performance may actually be better than the current ones (but I have not done a comparison).  I also will recommend the TRV130 for video editing; I have had no problems loading video off of the camcorder onto my Windows XP PC with a firewire cable.My complaints on the camcorder:1. Still uses tape, which can jam up inside the camcorder (luckily I havent lost a tape yet).  I've also been told specifically to use *only* Sony Hi8 / Digital8 tapes with this unit.2. There is a manual exposure setting, which is good for shooting candlelit scenes, etc.  But the camera is missing a manual white balance that I wish it had.  The white balance is done automatically when the camera is turned on; when indoors with natural light I will point the lens to a blue object at powerup to eliminate a bluish tint to the picture; likewise if the indoor scene is lit I will point at a warm-toned object to eliminate everything looking orange.3. The supplied Infolithium battery is useless.  I which Sony would include one of the larger batteries as standard.4. As mentioned above, low light performance could be better.  The low light settings the camera provides are rarely used.Altogether, I'm very happy with this camcorder.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent product after 4 years - only a few small gripes", "unixReviewTime": 1103673600, "reviewTime": "12 22, 2004"}

It is being phased out in favor of the Eton/Grundig E100.  These days there has been a trend for analog-tuned radios with digital frequency counters like the Grundig 350 field radio.  While these radios are easy to tune and bandscan, they do not have any memory presets and the tuning drifts after a few hours based on temperature and humidity.  The Grundig YB300PE, on the other hand, is a true digital radio and has 24 memories.

It runs on 3 AA batteries for what seems like forever in FM, and only a little shorter when always in AM or shortwave (cheap off-brand AA batteries are included).I can't really say that the speaker is useful for those who want to hear music but those folks are better off with the YB400PE, the larger cousin of this unit, or even Sony ICF-SW7600G.  No single-sideband is available but if you're serious about something like that you won't be buying a radio at this price, anyway.Overall a good radio for AM and FM digital preset channel surfers like me and the occasional jaunt into shortwave.

I've looked a mp3, minidisc, and regular cd players.  I finally chose to jump in and buy this mainly because I didn't want the mp3 craze to pass me by :^).  Here's what I think:Styling:  Look good.  It is almost exactly the size of a cigarette box but the depth is about 3/4 less.  The clippable pouch that comes with it is okay but you need to undo the velcro tie to turn it on and completely pull it out to vary the volume.  The pouch is quite cushion-any and probably saved me when I dropped it.  It does feel and look durable.  The blue backlit screen looks attractive.  The mp3 file names scroll across the screen rather slowly but, again, a minor point.Sound:  Apart from the miserable headphones (my main problem was static as the headphone jack swiveled around the entry socket) the sound is good to great.  I wasn't looking for &quot;knock your socks off&quot; sound anyway but I am quite happy with it.  The highest volume setting is not as loud as I'd like it but it doesn't bother me to any great extent.Loading music:  Loading is quick thru the USB port.  I use  RealJukebox Plus (the one that costs money) along with an add-on to manage music loading and I am very happy with it.  I didn't like the Rio Audio Manager but it works fine.  Setup was a piece of cake.  Very intuitive and fast.Memory:  64MB allows me to place almost any CD I have in memory.  I have a mixture of 128KBS and 192KBS sampling rates on my mp3s and at 192 a single CD is about all that fits on there.  The expansion port for memory upgrades will come in handy.Overall:  Nothing really to complain about.

On 3 of 4 computers I tried the Rio software on, the software failed to properly interact with the Rio,  popping up a dialog saying, \"Either your Rio is busy or it has insufficient  memory. Try turning your Rio off, then on again.\" A brain dead message - I  wasn't trying to copy anything to my Rio, so memory isn't an issue here.  Diamond's tech support did find a work-around that worked on 1 of the 3  failing computers, though.The reason I bought the Rio500 is because  memory is expandable using flash cards. More memory is good. Also, I have  some Compact Flash cards for my digital camera lying around. Unfortunately,  Diamond opted to call their proprietary memory card, a flash card even  though the memory is incompatible with any device using the standard  compact flash card. The only reason I can fathom for the similar name is  duplicity on Diamond's part.The other reason I bought the Diamond is for  use in the gym. I grow weary of the classic rock at Gold's and want some  Talking Heads, Lords of Acid or maybe Mozart. The carry case packaged with  the player, however, is tedious. The fabric mesh case completely obscures  access to all controls. In fact, while fumbling, I accidentally placed the  Rio into \"loop this track\" mode. How did I do this? There is no loop  button. Several minutes of inspection, between workout sets proved  fruitless. Later, after I got home and read the manual - fold out pamphlet  is more apt - I learned Diamond overloaded the use of the multi-button. Not  only does the multi-button turn, but you press it for selections. If you  have a Sony HandyCam, you know the drill. However, while in the gym, the  Rio's interface had me baffled. I blame Diamond for a bad interface.A  classic problem in the field of computer science is the knapsack problem.  The knapsack can store only some many units and given a selection of  different-sized units, the problem is to optimize how much you place into  the sack. The limited memory of the Diamond is the knapsack. Your MP3s are  the items you place into the knapsack. Unfortunately, when placing MP3s  onto the memory cards, you have to select which card the MP3 is stored upon  - either the onboard memory or the expansion. The AudioManager does not  optimize for you. Leaving you to figure out how to best use every megabyte  on your Rio. This lack of optimization is exceptionally tedious.Looking at the  specifications the Diamond Rio500 seems a winner, but after some use and  field testing, I realize terrible mistakes were made. Diamond duped me with  their illegitimate \"flash card,\" the AudioManager isn't fully baked and the  interface to the player isn't straight forward due to one button having  more than 1 function.

I will never again purchase another Diamond/S3 product, nor will I allow someone to do so w/o hearing me out first.For starters - the box says that it's firmware is upgradeable to  support higher memory capacity at a later time.  Then after we'd already  bought it - they said they wouldn't upgrade the firmware past 32MB cards.  A huge uproar came about from all the owners since other companies were  supporting the 64MB cards.  Finally they relented.Then the new Rio's  won't support the memory cards that you buy for this product.  And memory  is the most expensive part.  There won't even be some sort of an expansion  pack - the new Rio's will use a proprietary type of memory which means you  can't use it in your PDA or Camera - and you'll pay a lot of money for it  too.Then, there product is HIGHLY bugey.  Crashing often, it has huge  battery issues.  For instance - if you're transfering data and the battery  dies then the unit has to be reset at the FACTORY.  And this happens a LOT  because unlike other USB products that are powered off the USB Bus, the Rio  drains batteries like CRAZY when transferring files.  I end up having to  put in a brand new battery every time I transfer files just because I don't  want to deal w/ a Factory Reset.The USB cable - not sold anywhere so you  can't get a replacement. You HAVE to get 3rd party software to download MP3's  to the Rio because what it comes w/ is Useless.  The CDROM it comes w/ has  3rd party software that you can only use for 30 days, thankfully MusicMatch  and RealJukebox will take care of that.The Rio500 will not be upgraded  to support some of the new codecs (WMA) which are half the size of MP3's.  The Rio600 comes w/ it - so obviously they're recognizing that this new  Codec is the way to go, but they won't support their older products.And why not?  This &quot;older&quot; product is the most current product  available by them to date.

I wanted an inexpensive VCR with S-Video inputs. For those who may not know, S-Video inputs allow the transfer of 400 lines of resolution, as opposed to the usual 260 or so transmitted via RCA connections. In theory, the higher the resolution is the better the picture looks.FunctionalityIn addition to the VCR, there are a set of RCA cables and an S-Video cable included as well. Overall the unit is a piece of cake to setup. The unit has both RCA and S-Video jacks on the back, and a set of RCA jacks on the front. This makes it easy to hook up an external source (such as a camcorder or something) and record to VHS. I have my unit hooked up to my computer (it has a video card with S-Video out and RCA audio outs), and I haven&#65533;t actually used the input jacks on the front of the VCR. Another feature I really like is the simple 1-touch recording button on the unit. The way I have it set up, I can just reach up from my computer and hit it, and off it goes.This unit has a jog/shuttle wheel which is used to perform all the rewinds and fast forwards. I&#65533;ll have to say, this is my first experience with a shuttle wheel. I like it! It just seems more cool than a &#65533;rewind&#65533; or &#65533;fast forward&#65533; button. Lol The unit rewinds tapes faster than my old Zenith VCR.The clock is easy to set as well. I think this is an area which has been greatly improved upon in recent years. For that matter, all the menu items are laid out in a common sense manner, which makes programming and such even easier.I noticed some were saying they didn&#65533;t like the remote control, but I think it is just fine. Grant it, I don&#65533;t use it much, but the times I have used it, I haven&#65533;t encountered any problems with it.Two other things I really like are (1) Having a time code counter display on the LCD so you know how much you&#65533;ve recorded. (2) When you rewind, this little bar pops up on screen and shows you where you are relative to the length of the tape. It&#65533;s not really super useful, but I just like knowing where I&#65533;m at.Picture QualityI&#65533;ll have to say that for $, this unit produces great quality dubs in regular VHS mode. I&#65533;ve been using it for several months now, and the video productions I&#65533;ve produced always come out looking very good. And that&#65533;s the most important thing! I haven&#65533;t dubbed anything in S-VHS or S-VHS ET mode yet because none of my projects have warranted that. I would imagine that the picture quality would be even more outstanding than the regular VHS mode though.Nit PicksWhile the outer enclosure looks nice, the unit &#65533;feels- cheap. I don&#65533;t think it would hold up too well under any kind of rough conditions. Hopefully this VCR will reside either in your home theater or a setup like mine where it stays put and isn&#65533;t moved around too much.The cheesy &#65533;glow in the dark&#65533; keys on the keypad of the remote. I hate it when electronics manufacturer&#65533;s use these gimmicky things. They never work.ConclusionsFor the money, you just can&#65533;t beat this VCR.

It does come with a shoulder strap, which isn't uncomfortable. The camera has zoom capability, but I found that you have to be careful with blurring.  I don't fault the camera, but the photographer.  I have had some experience with blurred pictures and red-eyes.  Photo-enhancing software such as PhotoShop will take care of that.  I know because I've tried. The Mavica works well with Macs and PCs.  The only problem I came across was sending the pictures after editing them with PhotoShop.  If your mother doesn't have the same software that you do, then you will have to send that blurry or red-eyed picture of Junior.  Oh, well.

I write and edit a newsletter for a state agency and am often asked to take photos at award programs and/or to accompany job announcements, often with almost no prior notice.Of all the cameras I looked at in the 1990s, this was the one that best suited my needs. The reasons for that follow:1. Shooting photos on a diskette was easier than engaging software and changing documentation from the camera to a file on my PC.2. The 10X zoom is very accurate and allowed me to do adequate work even when I could not get close to my subject.3. The camera is flat out easy to use and has a large viewfinder, a large left hand grip, and big button to press when shooting pictures.Before I bought this camera, I worked for three decades for newspapers and in communications offices of governmental and nonprofit agencies doing the same kind of work I do now. In all those years I never used a camera that was as easy to use as this one, nor did I use one where transmitting the product from the equipment to e-file was easier.Having said that, this is a low resolution camera that will not always give good results. It is adequate for head shots and has always come through for me in events.But I've taken photos of my cats at home where their eyes look more like diamonds than eyes, and I took some pictures of the Christmas tree where the lights looked more like the stars or snowflakes than lights on a tree.So don't buy this to create award-winning photography. For all the same reasons, it doesn't produce very good hardcopy photos.But this is a great camera for someone that needs to take pictures right now and get an adequate product online fast. That's my mission at work and this camera has always helped me achieve it.In addition, the battery charger works fast and I've never had to pay a dime to get anything fixed in more than a half-decade of use.

Previously, I had owned a Nikon 35 MM &quot;point-and-shoot&quot; camera, but was interested in the advantages a  digital camera would provide;  immediate gratification through seeing your  pictures NOW, the ability to send JPG images to freinds and relatives, the  ability to delete pictures &quot;on-the-fly&quot;, etc.  What I got was a  mixed bag of results - mostly positive.Before I go any further, I must  advise you to get the following options:  two sets of rechargable NiMH  batteries which should be standard with the camera (I use the Kodak ones  available at Amazon.com), a higher-capacity memory card (I use a 128 MB San  Disk - Nikon's OEM), and some sort of adapter to transfer your images  quickly - the serial cable is just too slow.  I have purchased a SanDisk  adapter and insert the memory card directly into the PCMCIA slot on my  laptop computer for rapid transfer.Anyways, in use the camera is  fantastic.  Initially, I was using the 640X480 resolution setting to save  space, but with the new, larger card, I now use the 1600X1200 setting with  moderate compression for all pictures.  I find that the card can hold about  100 pictures at this resolution.  Once I find a picture I like, I use the  Microsoft Photo Editor software (comes with Office) and reduce the  resolution as appropriate (web pages, etc.).  I store my  &quot;keepers&quot; on CDROM at the higher resolution - you can always  reduce resolution and size.The picture quality is great.  The flash,  however, should only be used up to 10' - any further and your pictures come  out too dark.  Nikon USA has a web page with the latest firmware available  for download - which I recommend.Low points for the camera include the  fact that the lens resets to full zoom every time you turn the camera off!  I find myself zooming out every time I turn the camera on - this eats up  your batteries and takes time.  The flap that covers the memory card does  not always stay closed and flops open from time to time.  Sometimes, the  camera takes a while to reset between pictures, so a bit of spontaneity is  lost.There are now newer cameras out there.

It was a gift from a friend who is a professional photographer.

The camera pivots in half (which is quite disconcerting and a bit confusing) so you can change the angle of the viewing screen to the lens. The whole thing rotates freely 360 degrees, with snap-lock settings at each 180, so you can watch yourself \"taking a picture of you\" or use the viewing screen versus the manual viewfinder. The flash is a bit annoying, as it automatically fires in even remotely low-light circumstances. A simple press of a button disables the flash, but then you have a longer exposure time (about one full second) which means that you have to keep your hands really, really still. Just for fun, try taking a picture of the full moon and see how much you hand shakes.This camera is really at its best during the day. It should win an award for being the official picnic (or even beach) camera. It really is point and shoot, but it has an easy to learn and use zoom, auto/manual flash, and you can turn off the viewfinder with the push of a button if you are running low on battery. The live motion feed on the viewing screen is a bit jittery, but for the price that is nothing to sneeze at. My guesstimate is something like 3-5 frames-per-second of video capture on the view screen while you are searching for that perfect moment to snap the picture.The short version: It is self-contained, easy to load and swap the memory card. It takes high resolution photos, and is so easy to use (and durable) that a 5 year-old could handle it (carefully). Stock up on extra AA batteries though.

Of those tapes, my two favorite are black on white in this width and the 3/8\" width.  I prefer the 1/2\" width for hanging file folders because the label fits nicely on the tab.  I like the 3/8\" width (TZ-221) for use with manila folders because the narrower width positions closer to the edge of the tab.There is also a 1/2\" tape that is black on clear.  However, the clear tapes also show any dirt or debris that might be trapped behind the tape.  Thus, if you are in an environment that has even a small amount of dirt or other contamination, it may be readily visible against a light background after the tape is positioned.One other caution regarding these tapes; the backing can be difficult to remove.  The newer tape cartridges have a split backing that is easier to remove than the original single piece backing.  Even so, a certain amount of manual dexterity is required to remove the backing.UPDATE:  Since the time I originally wrote this review, Brother has modified the backing to be in two pieces, making the backing easier to remove.  However, the individual backing pieces can be a pain to throw away because they like to stick to just about everything through static electricity.This tape adheres readily; the print is nicely defined and has a high contrast.

Buying three or four tapes can add up to more than the cost of the printer.  This is how I deal with it.  Order three or more online at Amazon.  Remember, these labels help you organize your life and or business and or customers and I have come to believe the value of this outweighs the cost by a long shot. White on Black is the best as I have tried Black on Clear but if the surface is dark then you can't read the label.  I have used Whit on black but the letters are not as clear - the advantage is it looks classier then the white labels.Three years ago I purchased Brother ptouch PT-1950 (there is an update to this model which is even better) for about $72.00.  It is larger and heavier but you get much better results than the smaller brother PT-1180 which I bought around 2002 and replaced the cutter a couple of years ago.  The PT-1950 has USB and I recommend downloading the update drivers and free software from Brother because it lets you get more out of the tape reviewed here because you can print 3 lines instead of 2 and any font installed on your computer as well as many types of boarders.  You can even save the labels you make and open them later to reprint.  Once you go the USB route and see how nicely you can arrange your labels it is HARD to go back to the little handheld units.Review Starts Here:This is the classic black letters on white tape.The magic: the tape is separated from the backing in the label printer then the letters are burned with a thermal print head from the inside of the tape then it is stuck back down the backing and comes out of the machine. This is why the letters cannot be wiped off even with alcohol or other cleaners.Black letters on white works on all surfaces.  I have used black letters on clear backing which looks nice but requires the label be stuck on a light surface.  If surface is dark it is hard to see the label.  Black on white is also the cheapest most common tape.Brother's price is on the high side and I don't know of any generic aftermarket tapes.  Amazons price is about the best I have found and I trust Amazon.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TIP: Buy three tapes at a time so I don't run out and it makes the cost easier if you take your lumps in one shot!  If you buy the tapes one at a time you will be reluctant to use them when you need them.TIP2: Ways I use brother tapes:On the ends of power cords (like the type that comes with typical wireless router).

I have a home office as well as a shop filled with supplies for our events.  There is something tacky about sharpies and duct tape.  I have 4 different color labels (this one being the green) and so our 4 different setups each get a color.  Then on each label I can put my company info incase it is lost of misplaced.The label material it self is a heat transfer label.  Meaning if it gets hot it will become black.  The green is more of a mint green, which is not an issue unless you are trying to make it match something. Overall, the resulting label is very resilient to fading in the sun, being pealed off of most surfaces (some plastics like Rubbermaid they do not stick to) and the size is very readable in both large and small fonts which my Brother pTouch prints.Now the down sides, which can be big for some people.  I am 27, and for a guy I have nails, which I need to get the backing off.  There is no split down the center like a crack and peal, so you have to try at the corner for a bit.  Once  you do a few you get a method down but it is still a pain if you need to label a ton of things.  (My label maker has an auto cutter so if i have to make 20 of the same label i turn it off, print all 20 on one strip, peal the backing off of the whole thing then cut off the labels one by one with scissors)  The second issue is chemicals.  I have tried to use them in the garage, but brake cleaner, degreaser and some oils will rub the ink right off.  It is weird because it is a heat ink so it must be a layer on top of the label which i am wiping off, but either way I had a flashlight and I tried to clean the oil off of it one day and the label became blank.  The sticker it self was awesome and stayed in place with no problem.Over all a great little label product, 90% of the applications it works perfectly, and the adhesive becomes quite strong over time so they dont fall off in 2 weeks.

After reading plenty of reviews I kept finding myself turning back to this. Finally pulled the trigger and ordered one - even picking up a ~$10 savings on a repackaged one from Amazon's Warehouse Deals.I've had such success with the AA battery base attached that I haven't even been deeply tempted to permanently install the unit with a fixed antenna. Here's my take on it after a half dozen trips.Pros - Comes with everything needed to be functional, short of batteries and a fixed mount antenna.- Adequate range on alkaline battery power and stubby antenna.- More than adequate battery life. I did 2 day-long trips before I was tempted - not forced - to change batteries.- Startling clarity. A fellow 4 wheeler asked me what unit I was using, that he wanted to buy one for a backup / handheldCons - might be a minor point - or a technical nightmare - but it'd be mad handy if the unit could be used with 12v power andthe whip antenna..In short - there's not much more to be added to the fine reviews and the strong performance of this unit. For value, clarity, power, versatility and installation flexibility, I can't see this unit getting beat.Update:Relative to the \"Con\" noted above... I emailed Midland support to ask about the 12v / whip antenna issue, and to ask about a replacement volume knob. They very quickly and graciously responded that it is indeed possible to use the unit on 12v power with the included antenna. Here's their clarification:\"When you slide the mobile adapter on the bottom of the radio it disconnects the rubber duck antenna on the top of the radio. To avoid that from happening you canplace a small piece of tape on the bottom of the radio over the small squared contact right next to the 2 screws on the bottom of the radio before you slide on the mobile adapter.\"A replacement knob was sent as well.I tried out the unit with the 8 AA rechargeable base.

Out of the box I was picking up a few transmissions with the rubber ducky antenna, mostly truckers from the highway about a 1-1.5 miles away, and even some powerhouse channels from across the country. Using these as mobile units you could probably transmit to maybe 1/4-1/2 mile between two identical units with the rubber duckies which isn't bad when you're out in the field with a buddy. Once I had this setup in my Jeep however I was easily receiving transmissions from 5-10 miles away. I have this setup with all FireStik equipment:FireStik II antennaFireStik stud mountFireStik 18' coaxI'm also using a rugged ridge Jeep mount.The total setup yielded 1.0 - 1.2 SWR - pretty darn good on a Jeep.A few notes about using this in your vehicle. It's convenient when you don't want to mount a full size unit within the cab of the vehicle. It's so small that I can store it in my center console or the glove box - which is nice for Jeep owners since you can easily store it away to prevent theft. This unit has all of the functions of a full size CB within a tiny package the size of about a normal CB mic. The sound is very clear and the transmissions come off clear from what I've been told.The only thing I really didn't like about this CB is that the product description says full LED back light, however the back light only stays on for 5 seconds, even when powered via the car adapter. I figured that it would only turn off after a few seconds with the battery pack installed, which makes sense, but there's no reason the light can't stay on when you're in the vehicle. It's also only lit by 2 LEDs - one from each side of the display - not technically full back lighting, but clear enough to read the display from a few feet away. The only issue is when you want to continually toggle channels etc. at night, you've got to keep hitting the light button first. Also, which would be REALLY nice, is to have lighting behind the buttons, sort of like a mobile phone. There is no lighting behind the buttons so you've got to remember where each button is and what they do for night driving.Overall this is a 4 out of 5.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great setup for my Jeep", "unixReviewTime": 1359504000, "reviewTime": "01 30, 2013"}

In the mid 90s there was some what of a come back that may have lasted for a couple of years. In 2013 there really are not that many CB radios out there.  This is the reason I think some of the reviewers think their radio doesn't work, there is just nothing for them to pick up!  This being said, CB radio is still alive and used.  Truckers use them so you can always find out what the traffic is like, or where a speed trap is, and there are still people out there with base stations and mobile cbs providing for interesting conversation.  Just not as many as 35 yrs ago.  Having base stations, mobiles, and handhelds in the past I decided to re-enter the cb world with this Midland. It came nicely packaged with everything that is advertised. First I put batteries in it and listened in the house.  Heard truckers on 19 plus found that on 20 there is a whole group of locals that talk on their radios nightly. This was just using the included antenna.  Next I hooked it up to an old Firestik IBA5 Indoor Cb Base Antenna I had stored away, and I was picking up enough transmissions for the radio to be entertaining!  Next day I drove around with the radio in my F150 with the stock antenna and batteries. Nothing.  Not a single thing to be heard.  Last night I put a magnet mount Midland 18-2442 Mobile CB Antenna on top of my truck, and used the unique cable accessory that came with the radio. You snap it on to the bottom of the radio where the battery pack goes, and  you plug one connector into the cigarette lighter and the other to your antenna cable.  The radio pack and this device slide off very easily and slide back on securely, so you can attach it to the radio or take it off in a few seconds.  I ran the cable from the antenna through the door.  Closing the door on it was just fine  with no damage to the cable.  Now for the big test!  I drove 15 miles to work this morning during a major snow storm!  The radio worked like a charm.  I was picking up all the truckers (a lot of them) and getting reports of conditions around the whole area!  The rechargable battery pack allows you to run the radio home off of your AC current, or if you prefer use the regular battery pack for normal batteries, or use the car device with your cigarette lighter.  There are also jacks for a speaker and mike.  So essentially you can use this radio as a base station,  a mobile radio, or as a handheld!  Small enough to just slip in your pocket.  Also the sound, although not really loud, is vey clear and  easy to understand.  Radio also picks up the weather bands. I'm very happy with it.  I haven't transmitted to anybody yet, but I can tell transmit works well by testing it with an old handheld I had.  Distance would be measured by the type of antenna I use and how I tune it. Once I make a few contacts I'll get back here and let you know  how far I got. I buy radios for fun and in the week I've had this I have had a lot of fun with it, and would recommend it if you want to have some fun with cb radio.Update: Yesterday I was in a higher area (in my pick up using the Midland 18-2442 antenna) talking to a base station 7 miles away!

You can use the 75-822 inside or outside of the car with battery power (both adapters for alkaline and rechargeable batteries as is a charger for NIMH or NICAD batteries) and a rubber ducky antenna, outside with batteries and antenna or in car with DC power and an external antenna.  With the rubber duck antenna range is very limited for transmitting but it receives CB and weather okay.  With an external antenna you give up nothing over a \"regular\" CB.  I mounted my antenna to the roof rack and have a 2 ft Firestik FS and a 4 foot Firestick Firefly to use as needed. With the 2 foot reception and transmission are worlds apart from the rubber antenna as is weather.  With the 4 foot antenna I get all three NOAA weather stations and two are 30-40 miles away and transmitting can reach out easily 3-5 miles which is fine for legal CB power.

More people have CB's then any other type of radio because of the truck drivers, so I know there's a better then average chance I could reach someone else in an emergency with this radio.  I live fairly close to one of the busiest freeways in the U.S., and can get a signal with this if I step outside of my house.  I purchased a simple magnetic car antenna, and love how easy it is to swap this from car power to handheld power, so I know I'll be ready either way.the sound isn't super loud, but I can drive with the heater on full blast and the windows cracked on the freeway and hear it if it's near my head.  I've had no complaints about the sound quality, and get fairly good reception (so far 4 miles with the car mounted antenna for certain)Most CB's require a calibrated antenna of a certain length for maximum range, so I'm certain I could get farther range with a smal amount of effort, this functions as well as my old truck mounted CB I had when professionally driving.Great for camping, we talked the whole way down with the car mounts, then kept in touch in the park with the handheld packs.  Has a powersave option that keeps you going as long as your batteries can stand (I had to buy 8 rechargeable AA batteries seperately for the charger pack)  We did have a few issues when on the far side of the park from each other, but getting to higher ground put us back in touch again (this was a mapped distance of 6 miles from hilltop to hilltop)I've had otehr small scale cig lighter powered radios and this one has been better in every reguard.

I'm particularly pleased with the three modes of power; AA batteries, NiMH rechargeables, or 12v vehicle. The mobile vehicle adapter includes both a plug-in cigarette lighter power point and a coax connector for an external antenna. I use the Midland 18-2442 magnetic mount (it will tune to SWR of about 1.5 on channels 1 and 40) to significantly increase the range to several miles, depending on conditions. As a mobile radio, it works pretty well given that it's a one (small) size fits all type of unit. But what I really got this for was to use it as a handheld walkie-talkie. And that's where it truly shines. The provided rubber duckie antenna is nice and short, but it severely limits your transmit range. Use it if you don't need to talk more than a couple hundred yards. I mounted the Cobra HA TA telescoping whip antenna and got a tremendous increase in performance. Battery life is pretty good. The rechargeables will last all day with reasonable usage. Plug it into the charger overnight and you're ready for the next day.

If you are looking for a truly portable CB radio this is the one to get bar none. It is important to understand the capabilities of this radio. Many people rate radios poorly because their expectations far exceed the capability of the radio.  Most CB radios are 4 watts which is generally good for a distance of 2-6 miles. As with any radio there are a lot of variability's that will impact the effectiveness of the radio. CB radios are not for long distance communications. If you need long distance comms then you should consider a ham radio which requires a license from the FCC.Pros:+ Multiple methods to power the radio: Car charger, alkaline batteries, and rechargeable batteries+ 4 Watts+ Weather channels work great and can be very valuable+ Quick button to transfer between channels 9 and 19+ Very easy to use+ Radio itself is well built+ Can use high setting for 4 watts or low setting for 1 watt which will save batteriesCons:-The adapter for the car charger and alkaline batteries are very stiff when removing from the radio-Both alkaline and rechargeable battery cases seem delicate especially when being separated to put the batteries in the case. Time will tell how durable these will be over the long run.Recommendations:+ Upgrade your antenna to theCobra HA-TA Hand-Held CB Antennawhich, in my case, significantly improved reception. It is also good to have a backup antenna.+ Get theWILSON 305-38 300-Watt Little Wil Magnet Mount Antennafor your vehicle. You will not get reception if you use the rubber duck antenna in your vehicle.+ Get the bookEmergency Radio Communicationsby Caleb Watts for a good understanding of radio capabilities, rules & regulations, and a good example of an emergency radio plan.Overall Assessment:The Midland 75-822 40 Channel CB Radio is a very flexible CB radio that can be used in multiple situations such as in your vehicle or out hiking. The radio itself is very well made and while the battery cases seem a little problematic they are not a deal breaker but they do cause me to give this radio 4 stars instead of 5.If you are looking for a handheld CB radio the Midland 75-822 is a great choice.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Overall a Great Radio with Some Minor Flaws", "unixReviewTime": 1396396800, "reviewTime": "04 2, 2014"}

It turned out to be Jupiter.  It was a  highly recognizable Jupiter.  Not another dot in the sky.  I could see  three of Jupiter's moons in orbit.  I couldn't even make out Jupiter's  moons with the naked eye.I tried the telescope during the day for  terrestrial viewing.  Once again I was pleasantly surprised!

The first night we went out with just the Autostar and the telescope, assuming that we would have enough to get started. We were very wrong.In order to align the telescope and get the Autostar working, the unit first asked us to find true north. Yikes! We gave it a rough guess. We were off compleetely, we would find out the next evening. Next was the exact time, which we also guessed on our inaccurate watches. Then we picked the nearest city, which is about 30 minutes away. Then the unit asked us to find two stars in the sky and identify and align them in the telescopes eyepiece. The stars that the Autostar gave us to find were not exactly well-known stars, and they werent in a part of the sky that was devoid of other bright stars. Without a map of the sky, we were lost. Pollox, Rigel, Castor were some of the stars we have come to know well through the Autostar. Needless to say, we did not get the Autostar working that night.The next night, we went out equipped with not only the scope and the Autostar unit, but also a compass (to find north), a detailed map of the sky (to find the stars it was asking us to), and a watch that had accurate time on it. Before we headed out, we took the time to enter in our exact latitude and longitude into the Autostar. That night was a great success. After a short time spent aligning our two base stars in the scope, we were off to explore the universe and beyond. We saw Saturn, Venus, Jupiter, the Pleiades, the Orion Nebula and several Messier objects that evening.I highly recommend the Autostar, but wish that the booklet would have warned us that we needed to be prepared with the compass, star map, latitude/longitude, and exact time to make our experience with it successful.

One school believing that it takes away all the skill and fun from astronomy.  however, I'm a believer in the other viewpoint.  I think go-to capability opens up astronomy to the masses and brings the universe just that little bit closer to everyone.  I purchased the Autostar for my ETX about a year ago and it has had extensive use.  Out of the many many times I have used the autostar with the scope, I estimate it has performed as desired on 90% of my viewing nights.  Unusually, I seem to be able to align my ETX rather easily depsite the fact that many people have difficulty.  I think I have had luck on my side as the ETX, while a beautiful scope, can be a little temperamental.  Even after doing a quick and rough alignment, like pointing it in the general direction of due North, without using a compass, I still get very accurate results with the autostar.  I even changed locations the other day, moving from Auckland to Taupo, (some 3 hrs travel distance by car) and inadvertantly used the Auckland co-ordinates while viewing in Taupo.  Suprisingly after alignment, I still got accurate positioning from the autostar.  Once you get the hang of the menu system the autostar is really quite simple to navigate around.  The amount of data is staggering, but given the size of the playground, it's not suprising.  The unit itself is comfortable to hold and the adjustable brightness makes reading the screen simple in the dark.  I havn't found the built in red light at the top of the unit very good as it is just too dim to make out charts etc.  The trusty old torchlight with red nail polish on the lens is hard to beat on that score.  I suggest that if you are operating from a tripod, you attach something to the back of your autostar that lets you hang it up on the tripod when you are not using it. Otherwise it can dangle around and get in the way.  On a couple of occassions I have had the unit fail to operate correctly or reset itself. These have been far and few between, and readily fixed itself.  Ultimately the Autostar is a computer so an occasional reset is not entirely unexpected.  One minor problem I am experiencing at the moment is the scrolling text on the lower line of the display panel is tending to fade a little the faster it scrolls.  This has occured since I started using a power adapter for the scope so this will need investigating. This however is only a minor niggle.

If you want to protect your notebook from a determined thief, buy a safe.Most cable security devices are going to provide about the same amount of security so you need to focus on ease of use.  If a device is easy to use, then you're more likely to use it and use it properly.  The Kensington system doesn't get much simpler.  It consists of a cable, which is wrapped around a reasonably unmoveable object, and an attached key lock that attaches directly to your notebook's security slot.Compare the Kensington system with the Curtis 06414 system and you'll probably agree that the Kensington system is far easier to use.  Compare it's 1 piece system to the Curtis system which uses a cable, a seperate metal piece that hooks to the notebook's security slot and a seperate lock that connects that piece to the cable.  That's 3 seperate pieces, a little more effort to hook everything up and the possibility of losing that tiny metal piece the whole system depends on.I've used both the Kensington and the Curtis systems at work and have found the Kensington system to be far easier to use.  I put one key on my keyring, put the other key someplace safe and can toss the cable into my bag and be good to go.  With the Curtis system, I had to make use of its storage bag just so I wouldn't lose the individual pieces.

I say theft deterrent because a determined thief with a pair of strong wire cutters could probably get through it.

At about $20, it's a much better value.

It's what I upgraded to after using the Marble Mouse for so many years.

And I do regret a bit not having done Apple Lossless Format now.  By this I'm trying to say I have sensitive ears.I was so looking forward to the TEAC AD-500 to solve all my problems.  (1) I really wanted to be able to control cassettes with a remote control and (2) I wanted a \"real\" single-disc CD Player that functioned as such, instead of using a DVD player to play CDs, which is slower and inconvenient--the track number is not displayed, the \"screen saver\" often engages so you have to hit buttons more than once after a time, etc.The first thing I did when I unpacked the TEAC AD-500 was to set it up and attached it to my tuner so that I compare it against my existing equipment.  The cassette player was the most disappointing.  I currently have a Pioneer CT-W606DR, which remains the best sounding cassette player I have ever encountered or read about online (that has a reasonable cost).  I chose two cassettes to compare mainly because I new that the magnetic tape in them was in excellent condition and has great sound quality.  These were \"The Dealer\" by Chico Hamilton and \"Introspective\" by the Pet Shop Boys.  I tried both with speakers and with headphones.  The TEAC sounded pretty good, I must admit.  However, when you compare it against my current Pioneer, it paled in comparison.  The Pioneer had far greater treble response, yielding a far more vibrant and crisp sound.  There was also a far greater \"depth\" with the Pioneer--that feeling that you can reach into the sound to touch the individual instruments.  I should say that I had Dolby noise reduction off on both units.  I mean, the TEAC does sound far better than my two Sony cassette walkmen.  However, the promise of a remote control was not enough for fogive the lesser sound quality.The CD section of the TEAC is less dissapointing.  I was comparing it to a Sony DVD-Recorder RDR-GXD455.  The similarity was much closer here.  However, I have to say that the Sony came out slightly ahead of the TEAC.  The tonal quality of the reproduction was a bit richer and the highs were a bit more crisp.

The changer is quiet when changing CDs (rotating the carousel), and the display is readable from across the room.There are a few little quirks:  The changer differentiates between 'exchanging' a CD (thus not interrupting the currently playing CD, and not opening the drawer all the way) and 'open', which stops the current CD and opens the drawer.  Personally, I find the distinction a little annoying, since I almost always want to 'exchange'.  My previous Kenwood has no such distinction.I also wish the remote layout and buttons were a little more friendly to use by touch and not by sight--I like to listen to music in low light or even darkness, so I had to memorize some of the remote buttons (In particular, 'disc skip' is located in the middle of the remote).However, these are extremely minor nits.  The changer is excellent, feels sturdy, and has survived about 600 hours of use in the last 6 months.  I am delighted with my purchase and would recommend the changer to anyone looking for a low capacity changer.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nothing wrong with this at all", "unixReviewTime": 1139184000, "reviewTime": "02 6, 2006"}

These have become more frequent and annoying.  Pristine discs made no difference and changing the optical cable did not help.

Everything else is working and I do like the unit.  The sound quality is superior to my old Yamaha and the remote is better.I do not know if this unit can be fixed or, like with cars, the repair people cannot duplicate the problem.I am not going to put a lot of time, energy, or gas into getting this changer repaired beyond my first attempt.  Maybe DVD changers are made better and I can use one as a CD player?I am disappointed, to say the least, and from my experience, I know purchasing electronic components can be a gamble.  I hope your purchase goes better.Update: 1/21/09I took the unit in for warranty repair.  They replaced the laser and on the technician's equipment, both analog and optical cable connections were tested, the unit played flawlessly.  On my home system with a new optical cable, I again had the original problems.  I gave the unit to a friend and it works perfectly on his sytem using the analog connection.

Generally, if you use a higher grade tape for home recording you are not going to run into problems. In fact playing a high quality tape through your machine will actually clean your tape heads. Most times when problems develop is when you rent tapes or play pre-recorded budget tapes in your VCR. You may notice picture deterioration or even loss of picture, sound and tracking by playing contaminated tapes or tapes of an inferior quality where the oxide gets transferred to your video heads, linear audio heads, rollers and guides. In these instances wet system VHS head cleaner cassettes have always corrected the problem for me, but I have found that this Maxell Dry Head Cleaner corrects those issues just as efficiently and completely. This Maxell VP-100 VHS Dry Tape Video Head Cleaner really does work and you can maintain your unit and fix the problem on your own.I have found that for best performance, it is best to use dry head cleaners as part of a routine maintenance of your VHS player/recorder.

I've had to clean and repair plenty of them and occasionally used dry head cleaners for mild jobs. This thing is a piece of junk and doesn't clean anything. First of all, the box indicates the cleaner should be stopped after running for 20 seconds (always check the instructions for anything regardless of how experienced you are...never let ego or testosterone get in the way, guys...use a little wisdom). The only problem is there isn't 20 seconds worth of cleaner tape on the cassette. It runs for 11 seconds and stops. Second, it's not good when you place one of these (or a tape) into the machine and you hear a loud electronic sounding 'grinding' noise.

They work better as isolation headphones then anything I have used before, but apprently people who are audiophiles are not that impressed. Also they have fantastic volume ability. Because they are in your ear canal I can turn my portable equipment up really loud. I don't but its nice if you want to. Music sounds great with these headphones.

I assessed my options while remaining conscious of my budget and planned usage of the product, and decided on the Koss \"The Plug\" (or \"Spark Plug\") ear buds.  My other option was the Shure E2C model, as a friend owns these, and they sound phenominal.  However, since I don't foresee myself using my iPod all that often, I didn't up my budget to accommodate these.These headphones are of the \"ear bud\" style, which basically means that a foam/malleable nub is inserted into the actual canal of your ear (as opposed to ear pods, which snugly rest within the exterior of the canal.)  An important thing to know about ear bud-style headphones is that THEY WILL NOT PERFORM AT THEIR MAXIMUM ABILITY IF NOT PROPERLY INSERTED!  Instructions are clearly printed on the back of the package, and if not followed, you will NOT get the best usage out of your product -- in fact, the sound quality very well may sound terrible.To PROPERLY insert these ear buds, the ENTIRE foam nub must be fully compressed (via pinching and rolling with the fingers) and immediately inserted into the ear canal.  Additionally, your best bet is to gently pull your ear canal open by gripping the top of your ear with your thumb and index finger while inserting.  The ear buds then must be held in place (without shoving them in deeper) for approximately 8-10 seconds, while the foam expands into your ear canal, forming a solid fit.  If incorrectly inserted (i.e. not inserted all the way, not compressing the foam prior to insertion, etc.) highs and lows will sound AWFUL, even if you own a pair of $300 ear buds (yes, they do exist.)  Simply put, if you look in the mirror with the ear buds inserted and you can only see the plastic ear pod outside of your ear, then you can pat yourself on the back for a job well done.With that out of the way, the sound output of these rather inexpensive Koss ear buds is very impressive for the price.  The frequency response ranges from 10 Hz to 20 kHz, which is nothing to smirk at.  Distortion is cleverly kept to a minimum at all volume levels except for the very loudest point (I suggest breaking in your ear buds gently before hopping right in and destroying your ear drums.)  The bass output is subtle and effective for the most part, but doesn't perform very well with certain genres of music (while almost all electronic music sounds amazing, bass-heavy rock music or deep rap music may not produce the same satisfaction.)  It should also be known that there literally is no headphone, in-ear or not, that perfectly reproduces all styles of music, and this applies to even the most expensive models.  Any given headphone device will excel in certain categories of sound reproduction, while performing less impressively in others.  (Can you tell I'm an audiophile yet?)The few negativities to speak of are as follows.  The cable, while a decent length (not too short, not too long,) feels rather fragile.  Additionally, the included foam polymer ear buds are on the large side, and may or may not cause some minor to severe  discomfort after extended periods of use (upwards of an hour.)  Thankfully, replacement ear buds can be purchased in multiple sizes at most electronics stores.Overall, if you're finding yourself in the same boat I was and are looking for a suitable replacement for your disappointing Apple-brand iPod ear pods but don't want to break the bank, the Koss \"The Plug\" are HIGHLY recommended for the price.  I haven't heard any other in-ear ear buds in this price range, but I can imagine that these are hard to beat for the money.Just DON'T FORGET TO PROPERLY INSERT THEM EVERY TIME!  Once you get the hang of it, they can be properly inserted and snug in your ears within 15 seconds.  If you don't insert them correctly, they WILL NOT SOUND GOOD AT ALL, and you will have WASTED YOUR MONEY!  I'm a smoker, and even I hate wasting money!

I use my IPod almost exclusively for listening to podcasts while I do my morning walk and while I'm driving to and from work.  For that reason I didn't need high fidelity.What I was looking for was 1)a headphone that would block external noise and 2)stay in my ear 3)comfortably.  4)Good sound was important to me, but I'm not that picky since I don't listen to a lot of music.  Here's how \"The Plug\" fulfilled my criteria:1. Noise cancelling: 5 stars. If you take the time to compress the foam by rolling the foam between your fingers and get it inserted correctly you get almost no external noise.  It acts almost like a regular ear plug.2. Stay in my ear: 5 stars.  Again if you compress the foam and let it expand in the ear canal.  If you don't it still stays in well, but not nearly as well as it does when it is compressed and allowed to expand.3. Comfort: 4 and a half stars.  The half-star deduction is because the hard plastic part of The Plug presses against a spot on my ear and causes just a little bit of a pressure point.  Everybody's ear is shaped different so your mileage may vary.4. I did try these with music and they do sound great.  I've never had an expensive headphone so I can't give a comparison there.I really liked everything about the stock IPod headphones for my use except the ear bud itself.  The foam covers kept coming off and they didn't stay in my ear very well during my walk.  The Plug headphone does remedy those problems.I'm knocking off another half-star because The Plug headphones have a thin cord that gets tangled much easier than the Apple headphones.

You can stick them in your ears a little for a little sound blocking, or really roll up the foam and deeply embed them into your ears for near silence.* The sound blocking really lends to the quality of the sound output since you hear more of the music and less of whatever else is going on around you.* Produces a lot more sound output at the same volume. I attribute this to cancelling outside noise and channeling all the output right into your ears. Does this benefit battery life since you're running reduced volume? I'd think so, but probably not a noticable amount.* Nice long cord.* Seemingly good quality.* Includes extra foamies.CONS:* You have to sick them INTO your ear. Some people probably would hate this.* They can block virtually all outside noise. Someone could be axe murdering my family while I listen to music with these things and I'd never hear it.

Well, I was now headphone-less and desperate, so it was time to spring for a new one.I tend to like the \"in ear\" headphones because of the sound quality that comes through in loud environments (loud cities, subway, airplanes, road noise).  I bought the Koss \"Plug\" with hopes that the earplug-like earbuds would fit perfectly into my ears. I have normal-sized ears and don't usually have problems with store-bought earplugs for bedtime.  However, no matter how much I played around with the foam plugs on the Koss set, after 5-10 minutes of fantastic sound (yes, the sound IS amazing!), the plugs would just voluntarily fall out of my ears, for no apparent reason.  I tried squeezing, pinching, twisting, pushing, pulling, and even switching various plug sizes, etc...but with no luck.

Pritchard", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewText": "First, while I'm no audiophile and won't attempt to offer comments about the smooth, deep bass or crisp highs...your results may vary...I will say that I'm personally very pleased with the sound from these earbuds and find the isolation they offer is a real plus.  In fact, that's partly why I bought them:  Working sometimes in a very noisy environment that necessitates wearing hearing protectors, I thought it would be nice if I could turn them into headphones and at least enjoy some music while working.  I've never cared for earbuds that rest in your outer ear, so prone to falling out.  With the hearing protectors on over them, it was still rather easy to tug the earbug out of position.  &quot;The Plug&quot; stays quite well put, thanks to the soft foam cushions.  Away from work, the noise isolation of these stereophones continues to serve a great function, especially when travelling on airplanes or in any noisy environment.It is the isolation offered by the ear cushions that surely attribute to their efficiency.  Even low-powered headphone outputs on portable music players will likely still have all it needs to drive these plugs sufficiently for enjoyable listening.  The drawback of the ear cushions is, as others have said, that they do mean you must be careful about how you position the plugs in your ears, as that will affect overall sound quality.  The bass is excellent yet can become &quot;boomy&quot;.  That is why I say &quot;your results may vary&quot;.  But, for anyone willing to spend some time getting familiar with &quot;The Plug&quot;, I think they will be happy with the sound potential provided.Now...about the custom fit.  Yes, they really do custom fit to your ear canal if you choose the appropriate size cushions from those included.  However, again as mentioned, the provided cushions do not remain compressed very well while attempting to insert the plugs in your ears.  Moreover, while the foam does seem to be the best I've experimented with in terms of comfort against the skin and general acoustic performance, it doesn't hold up very well over time.  So, this led me to exploring for a substitute, and learning in the process what a difference in sound the type of foam makes.As I write this, I'm wearing my plugs, modified by replacing the Koss foam cushions with some I made myself from Aearo E-A-R Classic foam ear plugs.  The beauty of this approach is that as the ear plugs are designed for hearing protection, they do compress very well and hold their compressed shape longer, making it easier to insert the plugs into your ear canal, for a better and deeper fit.  But, therein lies the rub...it is that more deep, secure fit that affect sound quality.  My observation is that the impact is primarily upon the bass...making it even deeper and risking again a potential &quot;boomy&quot; quality.  I'm pleased with the results I obtained from the Aearo ear plugs after trimming them down in diameter so there wasn't quite so much foam to &quot;bulk up&quot; in my ear.  While the Aearo plugs work well and sound good, I've found an even more comfortable and better-sounding (I think) alternative in using Howard Leight Laser Lite foam ear plugs.  The latter have a Noise Reduction Rating of 32 and are made of a softer, smoother-textured foam than the Aearos.  I think the Aearos have a similar NRR, but they are not labeled with it.Now, how do you go about making your own ear cushion?  The approach I took was to compress one end of the foam ear plug down until it was basically flattened squarely against the other end on a flat surface.  Then, holding the &quot;pancaked&quot; plug in place, I heated a large nail over a flame and then pierced the center of the ear plug with the tip of the nail, pushing it gently through the foam so as not to tear the foam.  Rotating the nail tended to help.  Once the hole was pierced through the foam to the other end, I lifted the foam off the surface and pushed the nail fully through, this also serving to tug the foam along enough that it helped it to stretch back out along the nail shaft.  Once the nail cooled a bit, I slid the plug off the nail and had a rather cleanly pierced ear plug that I could then slip onto &quot;The Plug&quot;.  If the new ear cushion was too long or too thick to fit my ear well, I'd trim it down gradually with sharp scissors.  In the end, I made up several pairs of cushions to interchange as I like.  The Aearo plugs were rather easy to modify since the foam is stiffer and thus easier to pierce with the hot nail.  But, with care, the Laser Lite plugs could also be pierced without tearing the foam and they are smaller in diameter such that I found no need to trim them, except in length.  When the modified plugs are slipped over the sound delivery tube of &quot;The Plug&quot; earpieces, ensure the tube does not get crimped and extends fully through the cushion so as to deliver the best quality sound.This may sound like a lot of work for such inexpensive headphones, but they are great-sounding headphones for a small price and can be customized to your own liking with a similar approach to what I describe.When I'm not using &quot;The Plug&quot;, I switch to my Koss KTXPRO1 Titanium headphones...another pair of excellent headphones that I don't think can be beat for the price.  They too sound great and have very good efficiency, at about the same price as &quot;The Plug&quot;.  They are better-suited for an office environment where you need an open-air type earpiece to hear conversation through, rather than being isolated.  The volume control on the cord is also a real convenience and is the only thing I find missing from &quot;The Plug&quot;.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Efficient, Broad Response, Custom Fit...at least 4 stars", "unixReviewTime": 1083715200, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2004"}

I've owned a lot of portable headphones throughout the years and most recently have used a set of Koss SportaPros that have served me well; they sound good (not as good as the PortaPros, but still good) and were pretty cheap.  But they leak sound terribly, meaning they're not a great choice for listening on a crowded subway or while at work, and also are not that convenient to carry around.  When I recently bought an iPod and finally got to try out some in-ear headphones, I loved the convenience of being able to stuff both my player and the phones into one pocket when not in use, but I never could get the stock iPod headphones to fit my ear.  They didn't sound particularly good either.  So I knew I wanted to try something else.I first bought a pair of Sennheiser MX-500's, and while I actually liked their sound a lot (better than the stock iPod phones), they didn't fit my ears any better.  They'd fall out even if I so much as turned my head to one side.  One of my co-workers then recommended The Plug, and at such a low price I figured I'd give them a shot.I've now spent a few days with mine and my feelings on the whole are mixed, but I do feel these earphones are a pretty good value.  Most importantly to me is that so far, they're the only in-ear headphones I've found that don't seem to require constant fiddling to ensure they stay in place.  I do have to use the largest of the several types of included cushions - I apparently have very large ear canals - but they seem fairly secure (though not tight) once they're in there.  Some people may find this type of earphone uncomfortable - you really have to place them well up into your ear canals (make sure you clean your ears well every day!) - but I find them much more comfortable than the standard designs included with most portable players because you don't have this piece of hard plastic wedged into your ear.Sound-wise, I'd say they're fine, though certainly not remarkable.  My MX-500's sound better, and my SportaPros sound a *lot* better.  I'd put these about on par with the included iPod headphones.  They're pretty bass and mid-range heavy, though like other in-ear headphones the \"bass\" isn't really very bassy - it cuts off well above what most larger headphones can reproduce.  It ends up sounding a bit forced and artificially juiced, and there's a lot of this fake \"bass\".  On the high end, there's a lack of clarity - things like cymbal crashes sound \"muddy\" and ragged.  This is typical of low-end headphones of any type.Still, I'd rate the sound \"good enough\" considering the application most people will use these for (portable listening), and considering the increased comfort and dramatically better physical stability vs. more conventionally-designed in-ear headphones.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good for those with large ears", "unixReviewTime": 1109980800, "reviewTime": "03 5, 2005"}

First of all, everything you have read about the stock foam earpieces is true; they are worthless.  The foam expands way too fast for you to compress it, shove it in your ear, and have it expand to get a good seal.So I followed some of the recommendations given in the reviews here, and modified some roll-up foam earplugs.  Now at least they will stay in my ears.I am recommending that people spend a little more money and buy the Sony MDR-EX71SL Fontopia earbuds, and here's why:-They seal really well to your ear canals, once you have selected the proper size silicone adapter.  The result is excellent bass.-You can put them in and pull them out really quickly.  On insertion, they just go in and seal, there is no waiting around for the foam to expand and seal.  You can quickly yank one or both of them out, and be able to plug them right back in.  This is really a good thing if you want to use them at work.-The sound of the Sony earbuds is just plain superior to the Koss'.  Really, it is.  They are worth twice the money of the Koss', which is about what they cost.About the only reason I may keep the Koss' around is that, with my foam earplug modification, they probably block more ambient noise than the Sonys, and they seem to be more efficient (more volume for a given drive level).  These two factors make them a good candidate for use when I am riding my motorcycle.

This means that you will get more volume out of weaker amps, such as those found in multipurpose portables, like PDAs and portable synths, like the Yamaha QY series.  They also have excellent bass, which together with the dynamic range, makes them excellent for any sort of modern dance music.Unlike another reviewer, I did not find any problem with the midrange or high end.  I suspect that this perception some people have had, is due to the fact that increasing the bass automatically makes the midrange and highs seem muted - especially in headphones.As others have mentioned, the fit is critical to the sound quality.  Read the instructions found on the inside of the card in the packaging.  Even the orientation of the earphones in your ear can affect the sound.

Above it discusses a headband and an adapter which are not part of this product.  Also, the rated frequency response is 10-20k, not 16-23k.  I think this is (or was) an Amazon editorial error.My interest for this product is as a solution to listening to music, lectures, and movies while travelling, and I travel a lot.  I have a set of Panosonic noise-cancelling headphones which were good (about five times more expensive than these earbuds) though bulky, but the plastic broke so they won't stay on my head now.These earbuds are an excellent alternative to noise-cancelling headphones for the frequent traveller.  I find them more comfortable for extended listening than most conventional headphones.  The ability to seal out noise from the external environment is very good, and makes it possible to understand what actors are saying when watching a movie on an airplane.The overall performance - sound quality and noise blocking - is not as good as the Bose noise cancelling headphones, but the Bose are 20 times as expensive, much less convenient to carry, and subject to damage from the rough world of the road warrior.  If The Plug had an optional noise-cancelling unit (say, combined with the eq), it would be a killer combination - are you listening, Koss?).The sound is good.  Bass-heavy, to be sure; I would like them better if they had a flatter response, but the product is marketed at the portable music crowd, and many of them are looking for dramatic bass rather than golden-ears sound.Besides, mobile sound is always a compromise, it's just a question of whether the compromise they chose works for you.Here are some problems I've heard and the solutions:1. \"They fall out of my ear.\"  I think an older version of this product did not come with alternative cushions; the ones I bought recently (as pictured here) came with 3 alternative cushion pairs, one of which fit well in my somewhat large ears.  To make them fit well, roll the cushions in your fingers and squeeze them down, then hold them in place in your ears while they adjust the fit. Also, it is possible to fashion your own cushions (easy modification to commercially available ear plugs from pharmacy); go to google and search for \"koss plug mods\".2. What about when I have to replace the cushions, they'll get waxy/dirty with use?  See last sentence of #1.3. \"They sound tinny\".  I have a sense that the sound was tinnier on an earlier version of these earbuds, judging from comments I've read in feedback and on the koss plug mods page.  The purple plugs (as opposed to the older(?) blue ones) do not sound tinny to me; they seem a bit heavy on the bass instead.  Koss also makes a 3-band eq (20 dollars) for their headphones that can be used to adjust the sound some.  I have an eq on order, hoping it may temper the boomy bass a bit.  Of course, your player may have a way of changing the color of the sound, but my laptop does not.4. \"They're easy to lose.\"  The price of their tiny size and negligible weight, is that you need to be careful not to lose them.  I've already lost a pair.  Koss also makes a carrying case which may help, or you could just put them in a 35mm film canister.  But at $... a pair (compared to $... for noise-cancelling headphones) I'll just keep a spare pair around in my travelling case.Overall I'm pleased with the price/performance tradeoff for these earbuds, and they are an essential part of my travelling kit.  They sound better than any other earbuds I've used, and they remove a good bit of the ambient sound, offering more pleasure in listening.  I give four stars out of five because I'd prefer a less bassy sound, though some people will really like the way they sound.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good, cheap sound solution for the traveller", "unixReviewTime": 1055116800, "reviewTime": "06 9, 2003"}

I've found that by plugging just about half of the little holes on the back attenuates the bass if an EQ isn't an option.

On the New York City subways and city streets, isolating headphones are the only way to really hear your music without getting those huge over the ear style headphones.  I see everyone with the white iPod style earbuds - can you even hear your music?  I swear that I had to turn the volume up all the way to even hear the music over the din of the city streets.So, I'm already a convert to the in-ear experience.  These headphones, however, are a total bummer.  They don't fit in my ear with any of the built in foam inserts.  They hurt.  The sound is tinny, tiny and has no bass whatsoever.  I tried every permutation of different foam plugs with no luck.I'm sure the poor sound is entirely because they don't seal in my ear canal well.  I looked around on the web - other people are having the same problem, and have gone so far as to create their own foam plugs to fit their ears better.

I used it in the plane and it blocked 70% of the engine noise! Economy class really spikes your ears so they should sell these in airports. Also the plastic dried up(I don't know why!).My tip: never tie the wires! it causes the metalic wires inside to break.

The tube that you see when you removed the plugs was mostly rubber(unlike totaly in plastic) so it's improved. The extra plugs where all different sshapes and sizes so there are some that I can't use. The main problem is that sometimes I sleep on my side while wearing them and the plug breaks.Second tip: I have two versions, blue/yellow and purple/gray.

For a city denizen like me, common noise pollution is subway trains, sirens, chatty cell phone blatherers etc. Airplanes are another problem for portables because of noise.  The plug, by blocking outside noise so effectively, solves this problem.Another bonus you don't see often is that Koss backs all their products with a lifetime warranty.

This Koss unit was no more expensive from Amazon than another \"no name\" from an electronics store, and I've been a big fan of Koss since the late 70s, so I bought it.First, what it IS and ISN'T.  This is a volume control, but NOT an amplifier.  It will make your MP3 player, etc., quieter, but NOT louder.  If your source is too quiet, look for a headphone amplifier.When I used to listen to a cassette walkman it was easy to turn down the volume when I needed to.  The volume control was a thumbwheel right on the player.  I have several MP3 players now, and they all have hi-tech context sensitive controls.  This means (for me, anyway) that I have to look at the screen to make sure the button or slide control is set for volume.  This control solves that problem.  Set the player for a volume slightly on the loud side and use the inline control to get comfortable sound.  If you need to lower the volume (to talk to someone, for instance) you can use the volume control without taking your player out of your pocket.This model has a three foot cord between the player and the volume control.  This is nice if your player has an FM tuner -- MP3 players use the headphone cord as an FM antenna.  My generic ones were only about 8 inches long and the FM reception suffered.The control has a clip on it, so you can wear your player safely in a padded pouch on your belt and clip the volume control to your chest pocket.A few reviewers have noted that lowering the volume attenuates high frequencies.  I tried using the EQ settings on my player (I was also using Koss PortaPro headphones).  When I had Bass Boost EQ settings I did notice some high frequency attenuation in both the Koss and generic inline volume controls; when the EQ was turned off I didn't notice as much high frequency attenuation, but the sound was very \"flat.\"  Anyway, I don't think I would have noticed it if other reviewers hadn't pointed it out.An inline volume control is very handy for portable MP3 players, etc., and this unit is well thought out, and works great.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent for MP3 players with FM tuners", "unixReviewTime": 1237248000, "reviewTime": "03 17, 2009"}

The majority of ear buds these days have cords that are much too short for everyday use often resulting in the ear buds pulling out of your ears or the cord coming unplugged from whatever device you're using.  This is where an extension cord/device such as this one is very useful.  Like many people, I sit at a desk in front of a computer all day, listening to music much of that time.  The iPod dock that I have on desk is just far enough away that my ear buds don't quite reach and wearing them isn't practical or comfortable.  Thus I purchased this item to add some cord length and some extra volume control.  Here are my thoughts;Pros+ Adds approximately 3' in cord length.+ Volume control switch is at the end of the cord and has a clip to attach to whatever you're wearing or carrying.Cons- Sound degradation is extremely noticeable.  Feels approximately like a 30-40% loss of sound because of the extended connection.  While I expected some loss I didn't expect quite this much.  The Volume switch barely raises the overall volume unless you have your device volume at max.- Flimsy wiring and weak connections tend to short out quickly if there is moderate or active use.- Amazon's stock photo doesn't exactly match the item I received.  My model matches the customer image that was submitted so there are slight differences such as the angle of the male end of the plug.  Could be problematic for some.While this item is useful to me in my particular situation I'd rate it poor overall.  It works for me because it will stay at work on my desk and not see any travel use.  Since I don't listen to my music very loud at work as I need to hear if coworkers are speaking to me, the low volume isn't a huge issue for me.  However, if you're looking to purchase an extension for your normal headphones to carry with you this is NOT the device for you.

,{"reviewerID": "AARTX8A7CN0PB", "asin": "B00001P4XH", "reviewerName": "Neil \"Scrantonian\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": ".I use my new Koss \"Remote Volume Control\" on my desktop computer, in line with my powered speakers.Remanufactured Harman Kardon HK595 2.1 Computer SpeakersWhen I'm at the computer, I always have it playing something -- streaming music, news, National Petroleum Radio, whatever.  And the computer has a dozen \"virtual\" volume controls -- Winamp has a few volume controls; Windows has even a few more for adjusting the volume.  Why should I add the Koss?Pros:But, nothing compares in convenience to being able to reach out to a physical Volume Knob laying on the desk.  No mousing required.  Faster than a mouse or keyboard control.In fact, my keyboard has a dedicated volume control on it, which I used to be impressed by.  But it works through Windows, so sometimes its action is delayed after I hit it, and then it starts moving at some arbitrary speed when I hold the button down.  So it's a minor challenge to make quick, delicate adjustments.The tiny knob in the Koss has a silky feel to it.  I'll let you know in a few decades if the physical control ever gets dirty and scratchy.At the Loud end of its adjustment range, the control is very gentle and smooth.  So if you turn the Koss to maximum volume, and adjust all your virtual volume controls so the audio is just a bit loud, then it's easy to use the Koss to cut back the volume slightly and make very delicate adjustments around the desired volume setting.  Of course, the Koss can also reduce the volume to Zero, smoothly.Amazon published another review, the Koss' \"Most Critical Review,\" where the reviewer observed that the audio got muddy when the volume control was turned down to its lowest settings.  I wouldn't use it at the lowest settings, anyway, because else you're going to blow your ears off if you turn the Koss up towards the high end of its adjustment range.  Anyway, it seems clear to me that the other reviewer tried compensating for the Koss being turned to the low end by turning up other volume controls in his system so that he could hear the audio, and one of those other volume controls was causing distortion.  I.e., it wasn't the Koss at fault for causing the muddiness, and his 1-out-of-5 star review is erroneous.  I can confirm that there is no fidelity change when the control is turned towards its Low end.Cons:There's a clip on the Koss, so you can attach it to your shirt or short-sleeve and use it while you walk your mp3 and your dog.  The wire is plenty long enough for that (my wire is about 2 1/2 feet long), but if your desktop computer isn't located on your desktop, the wire might not be long enough for you to reach the volume control -- not unless you add an audio extension cable.  And you know, adding more audio plugs and sockets threatens to make more scratchy connections.The wire itself is thin.  We're talking the type of wire that has a few wisps of copper for the audio, a few more wisps for the ground, all inside a 1/16 inch diameter plastic sheath.  If I treat it gently, it will last a while on my desktop.  If I were to take it jogging and toss it around thoughtlessly, it wouldn't last a year.  Thinking of opening up the housing (which is glued shut) and re-soldering the connection?  Those wisps of copper and their tiny connections are very difficult to work with; good luck.Another reviewer mentions that he buys one of these periodically.  He blames himself because the wire breaks, periodically.  I think some blame should be reserved for the delicate design of a product whose function it is to be used on the run.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Controlling your volume with a \"knob?\"  That's so old fashioned", "unixReviewTime": 1389139200, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2014"}

The product I reviews has a slightly different casing that the image and also the wording is not white but grey. My problem is that in this case I feel with this image the seller is trying to give a somewhat skewed image on the device.For one, the 3.5mm male connection(going into your device that is producing sound) is not a right angle connector. This can be a issue for some users since depending on their intended usage a straight connection can cause undue torquing on the 3.5mm port potentially causing damage to either the connector or the jack on the device itself. To balance this somewhat the 3.5mm cable is flexible and the jack is fairly small in comparison to some straight jacks that are larger and stick out quite far.Secondly, the metal clip that is supposed to attach the device to a shirt, pocket, ect.(which is not shown in the product image) is really cheap so does not hold fast to whatever you try to clip it on.Lastly, the volume control it recessed into the chassis so it only protrudes slightly. This can be taken as a positive or a negative depending on your perspective. On the positive you will not have any issue with the volume control breaking or the volume being altered unintentionally. However because of this, altering the volume can take slightly more deliberate effort than usual. It also means that it might be uncomfortable for those of you with larger fingers. This again has to do with your preference and how you change the volume(either with the tip of your finger close to the nail or with the flat of the tip of your finger.)Overall I would have preferred the item been closer to $5 than the $10 it costs, but I was in a hurry(which I rarely ever am when it comes to electronics). So keep what I said in mind and look around for something that might fit you better before deciding. That is unless you were like me and just need an inline volume controller quickly and without hassle.ADDITIONI noticed this a while ago buy forgot to add it to my review, when changing the volume the sound to the headphones(or whatever device is connected)is changed so that the volume in one ear becomes louder than the other.

Portapros are produced all the way since the 80s and have a flimsy look. My doubts continued as I was unpacking my Portapros. Could this little, flimsy, plastic set of headphones be that good? All of my doubts have evaporated once I have tried using them. These headphones have two big pros:1. Sound quality: One thing you should be aware of is that these headphones are _loud_. I have compared them to my Sennheiser HD201 and Sony MDR-A34. There is no comparison. Portapro is much louder. Of course, if you don't like it, you can turn down the volume. However, despite the loudness, the sound is excellent. I can pick a lot of details in my music CDs that were nearly undetected with the MDR-A34 and barely audible with the HD201. When I play first person shooter games, I am getting excellent directional sound.2. Comfort: The comfort is excellent. The headphones sit very tightly on my head and yet they don't apply much pressure to my ears. I can wear my Portapros for hours without feeling any discomfort. The reason for this, is that these headphones come with extra cushions the sit above your ears and shift some pressure to your head leaving very little pressure on ears. You can also choose how much pressure you want to have applied to your ears. If the default is too much, you can shift some of that pressure to the auxiliary cushions by changing the \"Comfort Zone\"  settings (the blue buttons above the driver, it's best to start playing with them once you already wear the headphones). Since the headphones sit tight on your head, they're suitable for outdoor or gym use. The cable length is just right to reach your PC speaker or mp3 player (about 3 feet), but I suppose that some people will find it too short. Finally, the set folds easily and fits into a small leather bag provided for portability.And, have I mentioned lifetime warranty? If they ever break, just send them to Koss with a $6 check. They'll fix or replace them for you.

Turns out, these have a lifetime guarantee, and for $6, they will repair or replace them for you.  I got the new pair in rapid order-- total turn-around was about 10 days.  Caution--if you send these in for repair, do NOT include the pouch;  they returned only the headphones, without the pouch.  Anyway, it was really nice having the new headphones.  BUT, this morning, I picked them up to put into the little carry pouch I use for my Nano and headphones, and found that the left earpiece was dangling again, broken at the swivel point.I really like the comfort of these headphones and the fact that I don't have to crank up the volume to hear.  But, I am now actively looking for a replacement to use, as these are obviously too frail for the constant folding and unfolding they get for my commutes to and from work.  Sorry to have to do this, but I would change my 4 stars down to 3 (but Amazon is not letting that happen).If you will not be stuffing these in a storage pouch but will be simply laying them on a desk or table, then these are great.  If you plan to fold and open a lot, I now suggest you look for something more durable.Sorry, KOSS!------------origianal review Jan 6, 2007:Quality good enough to make me get  a 3rd pairI have gone through 1.5 pairs of these things, now (my current pair is nearly ready for replacement).  The first pair finally broke apart while folded in the soft bag that comes with it (I had had those about 6 or 7 years) -- I took them out and the left earpiece had broken at the plastic attach point and was left hanging.  My second pair is now only 2.5 years old (purchased April 2004), and the wire at the plug end is getting iffy.  If the wire moves, sometimes the phones go into single ear mode, so I guess one of the wires inside the very thin cable is breaking at the joint.  This plug has a right angle into the player, and it is right at the cord end of  the right angle piece where the wire is weakening.  I am going to try taping it here to keep it from moving, and see if that solves the problem temporarily.I do side by side test with this headphone and others used by other individuals.  I ask them to put the volume where it won't blow out my eardrums, then I listen using their phones and settings.  I then plug in my portapros, and listen.  So far, I have not found anyone's setup to beat  the quality and clairty and volume delivered by these phones.  Usually, I have to turn the player DOWN when I plug in my phones because they pick up so much more than others.If you are prepared to buy a new pair of these every 5 years or so, then these are definitely a good deal.I just wish Koss would send a hard case for storage since I do believe that the soft case does not protect them enough when they are stowed.  Koss could also thicken the cable a little bit to make it more durable, or do a gradual thickening as the cable nears the plug.  When I get a new pair, I will tape that end of the cable to try to postpone this problem -- less than 3 years is too soon for this to happen.Becasue of these two design flaws, I rate these a 4 intead of the 5 that the quality of sound delivers.I listen to jazz, smooth jazz, pop, rock, and audiobooks primarily.Happy listening!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "not durable enough -- my revised review changes star rating down to 3 stars", "unixReviewTime": 1168041600, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2007"}

You don't have to turn them up very loud to get a full sound. Bass is very strong, it can be a little too strong at times depending on your musical taste. I listen to a wide range, from classical, to Hip-Hop and for things like Jazz and Classical I find that these struggle a little because the sound separation is okay, the highs are a little on the flat side and the bass can be a little imbalanced.

I don't like distortion or over amplification that creates distortion.But if one prefers that heavier, distorted bass sound, which many do, these are the ones.They are SOOO comfortable, but then again so are the PX100s.I for one, couldn't care less what others think if they look cool, ugly, whatever. What is essential is the comfort and audio quality.If someone is really bothered because they are NOT in a style that is not currently marketed, then I feel the issue is withe the individual, not the headphones.They really are great and I see at 29.99, a great buy.OR ... if you want, you can pay of $100, and get some heavily marketed headphones that are more stylist, but will be a more more uncomfortable and probably not sound as good as the PortaPros or the PX100s.I also will tell you that I cannot stand the headphones that are made to drown out sound.

Yes, there is a caveat- I paid $40 for these, and for *that price* they have fit and/or surpassed all of my expectations. I believe these can compete with any headphones in the &lt;$100 range. I do have two complaints, though.Audio: 4/5. Bass is powerful, highs are clear, mids are crisp enough. Perhaps a little too well blended for rock (not much emphasis on treble), but fantastic for acoustic/instrumental pieces and hip hop.I dock 1 star because of the utter lack of sound isolation. Having on-ear pads with no noise cancellation tech really means NO noise cancelling (duh). This is fine, but it also unavoidably detracts from sound quality when there is any noise around you. The pads also bleed sound easily- I had to be mindful even playing at half volume in public.Aesthetic: 5/5. As authentically retro as you can get, since they are literally from the 80's.Build quality: 5/5. Simplicity makes for durability in this case.-1 for hurting your ears after a couple hours of wear. Fortunately, you can adjust the pads so they angle away from your ears, shifting the pressure up to the side of your head.

Great alternative to ear buds or full cans, somewhat portable because they can fold up but they are a little flimsy so I would not recommend packing them tightly or under heavy weight in luggage.

Tired of the awful sound of default earbuds, I've experimented with Shure, Bose, Sennheiser,Klipsch, andJVCbrands, ranging in price from $25 to $100, but have never really been satisfied with sound signatures that were either too bass-shy, too muddy, or cramped soundstage. Eventually, I got tired with the uncomfortable and often dirty world of earbuds and decided to go back into the world of on-ear portable phones. Reading at Head-Fi about theKoss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphones, I ordered them from Amazon. While no match for myAudio-Technica A900x headphonesat home, I was impressed with the richness and spaciousness of the KSC75s, but it wasn't long before I found the clips uncomfortable for my ears, so after a couple of months I went ahead and ordered the KSC75's big brother, the PortaPros.I couldn't be happier with my decision. The sound signature is very similar to the KSC75s, but there is a touch more bass and depth. It's not a flat, analytical sound, not too muddy but very fun and warm -- perfect for portable listening around the office. They're open phones, so you'll be able to hear your surroundings and anyone nearby will be able to hear what you're listening to at high volumes, so bear that in mind. Build quality is fair, about what you'd expect for the price range, but the PortaPros are very light on my head. Considering that their sound is superior to a couple pairs of $100 earbuds I've used, I'll take the trade in isolation for comfort and sound quality. I'm also a fan of the 1980s styling.They're not perfect. In addition to the openness and build quality, the headband occasionally pulls out a hair or two, but it doesn't happen often enough to be burdensome. While the PortaPros fold down to a surprisingly compact ball, getting them into the included travel pouch can be a tight fit. Overall, the negatives are greatly outweighed by the positives.If you're in the market for a modestly-priced portable set of headphones, the Koss PortaPros are highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Best Portable Phones I've Owned", "unixReviewTime": 1386201600, "reviewTime": "12 5, 2013"}

That in itself should tell you something about this product. I recently bought a notebook computer for around $500. It has a 750GB hard drive. Back in 2000 I bought my first notebook. It had 6gb and cost $1,100. In Electronic product terms these should have been retired decades ago. There are good reasons they haven't been though. The longevity of the PortaPro speaks volume about this product.I am fortunate enough to have a Soul by Ludacris SB300. It is a $300 headphone. I like it a lot. It produces an excellent all around balanced sound that brings out vocals and all instruments. The PortaPro does the same. The PortaPro actually sound better. The sound is breathtaking in its accuracy and clarity. They even leak less sound, are lighter, and require no batteries.  The PortaPro bring an unbelievably accurate, well-balanced, rich, detailed, and lush sound for the price. You are getting the music, all of the music, the way the artists wanted it to be heard. It isn't often a product can cost 8 to 10 Times less than other good products but the PortaPro does. You can get new headphones And a new iPod or other MP3 player and spend less than other headphones and still have the better set of headphones.And they are VERY comfortable and light. The headphones themselves are well padded as is the adjustment bar above. And the adjustment bar works. I have it set in the middle of the comfort zone and get just the right amount of snugness. You also get virtually zero sound leakage. It makes the PortaPro the Perfect work headphones: fantastic sound, virtually no sound leakage, comfortable enough to wear all day, very light, foldable and storable.The only nitpicking I can do is that the headband is not padded and they look maybe a little goofy. But the `goofy' gives you that nice comfort zone. All in all a quite extraordinary product. If Amazon had a product hall of fame where items made it for a combination of performance and value, the PortaPro would be in it for sure. A great gift for yourself or a friend or family member. Lastly before I bought these I did some research and they do have a lifetime guarantee. You can send them in and the shipping back costs a total of $6 from what people related on the internet.

I go through at least a pair every year. I guess I don't treat them amazingly and I like having music on me at all times so they get worn out fast. I realized awhile back I can go two ways on my next pair: cheap and easily replaceable or expensive and higher quality (hopefully lasting longer). I tried the latter a couple times since I'm a bit of an audiophile but this time I was sick of the joint at the jack breaking which is how pretty much every pair I've ever owned has broken (can't wait for the day of cheap, good sound quality wireless!).Then on CNET I saw the Koss Portapro listed as the best bargain headphones and I thought hell why not, my last pair were $10 and they only lasted six months. Got these and I'd say its probably the best dollar to quality value money can buy. The sound is rich and full, especially in the base department. When I first started using them, the treble sounded a little muffled but after a break in period I stopped noticing. I listen to a lot of bass heavy electronic music as well as alternative/indie rock and these cans are perfect for it. Because they're over here, you're not going to get great isolation but its good enough. Loud traffic might leak in a bit (and a good bit of sound leaks out) but its just enough to be aware of your surroundings while enjoying your music. I leave the fit on tight to get the best isolation though you can conveniently loosen things up if you want. They feel very nice on my big head either way with the temple pads. The retro stylings are pretty cool and they're definitely unique in their design.Some problems:I like the portable collapse mode but the included case (which is actually a very nice little pleather bag) is too tight a fit. Every time I squeeze the cans in there I'm afraid I'm going to break them or that I'm wearing the wire connections unnecessarily. I'll probably end up using the pouch for some other purpose though since it is quite nice. Along similar lines, it seems like they cut the cost so low by chucking out a lot of the casing and other \"useless\" plastics on the headset but that makes them feel overly fragile. So far they're holding up fine but they definitely feel a bit light. Likewise the plug is a bit small and looks like a definite Achilles heel. Lastly the cord is only 4' so if your audio source isn't in your pocket or nearby, you may run into trouble sans extension.Summary:Great deal for the money so why not?

The PortaPro has significantly more bass. I had to keep the volume at about 50% what I keep it at for the Sennheiser. The PortaPro is perfect if you're really into bass, if you're really into the beat. The Sennheiser is better for purity of sound. I just feel that, in general, it gives a truer, purer sound. The sound that the original artist had in his/her head. A lot of people will LOVE the beat on this. But some people will find it overpowering. I'm listening to \"Something\" by The Beatles right now, and I'm pretty sure George didn't want Paul's bass to dominate so much.Or maybe this is the best way to put it: you know how when you go into the movie theater and the previews start playing, you're struck by how great the surround sound is? It's so rich and bassy, you can practically feel your bones vibrate. That's what the Koss PortaPro is like. It's GREAT for watching movies. But it just doesn't give the purest vocal sound for music. If you want to turn up the volume to focus on the vocals, the bass will deafen you.The sound went out in one side after 6 months. The headphones lay on the shelf for a year, because I never got around to mailing it in for warranty (they'll replace it for you but it isn't free). And then I decided to fix it myself, so I got a new plug from Radioshack and got down and dirty with wires for an hour. After 45 minutes I was cursing myself for choosing to do this myself. But finally I got it to work. And to keep it that way, I'm not going to use it on the move. I recommend getting a cheap pair of earbuds for when you're moving around (the Sony MDR J10 is my favorite - it stays on and it has lasted me longer than any other brand), and keeping these relatively more expensive headphones for use at home. As you move around, the wire bends in your pocket, and eventually the connection is severed.Oh, and I agree with other reviewers that these headphones do get painful after a while.

I had some Koss earbud headphones that I loved but lost, so I needed new ones. So I came on here to find reviews of other headphones and saw that the reviews for the PortaPro were great. Since I had a great experience with Koss in the past (they replaced my earbuds on my old phones for free, no questions asked), I decided to try these. The reviews are right-on.I'd describe the sound of these phones as if two of the best speakers you've ever heard were on both sides of your head. The sound is great at all volumes. The clarity is such that I can hear parts of songs that I never heard before. The lows, mids, and highs are perfect. Some headphones sound bad at high volumes, and the sound gets muddy and the bass sort of shakes in your ear. Well you don't get that with these. It's like you're in the studio recording with the band. You can tell the difference between a 160kbps, 192kbps, and a 256kbps mp3 file with these headphones. The only thing I don't like about them is that I can hear outside noise, like cars whizzing by (a good thing, I guess) or the engine on the bus. This can be kept to a minimum by turning the volume up.The headphones look big because of the \"headrests\" they have, but  they are ergonomic. I was playing a video game while listening to these phones at forgot they were on because I didn't feel them on my head. They have three comfort settings: light, medium, and firm. They also come with a little case which is nice. The phones fold up to the size of a baseball, and both speakers fold inward. A small clip exists on the bottom of each phone, which attaches both sides together when you fold them. You then wrap the cord up and go. They can fit into a typical pocket. These are portable headphones, and I don't know why people say otherwise.They are some of the best headphones I've ever heard. No surprise Koss makes them.

They give a totally different sound then in-ears or closed design phones, but for what they are I would say they're good. I currently own six pairs of phones, from stock apple earbuds to Sennheiser HD 518s. Gave my Portapros a run on both my computer's sound card and mp3 player, using 256 kbps mp3s or better. The clarity is good and they're very lightweight. The folding design is simple but effective. The look is certainly retro and unique, although I didn't find it as comfortable as many have claimed. Earpads are *very* thin and made my ears sore after 30 minutes of listening, although this can be remedied to a point by adjusting the \"comfort zone\" feature (tightening the temple pads while loosening the ear pads). The cord seems to be an average thickness, but I wouldn't get too rough with these. The steel headband adjusts smoothly and easily, just watch out that the slider doesn't catch your hair. Despite the sore ears, the phones are very lightweight overall.Back to the sound: as you would expect, it's good for a portable phone, but hardly earth shattering. At flat EQ the clarity is good, although the highs can sometimes be harsh. Bass is weak as expected, even with EQ adjusted up. To be fair, a portable on-ear would have a tough time comparing to the bass of an in-ear with a good seal or a pair with larger drivers. No sound isolation offered if you're into that sort of thing. Cool 80s phones, though I've certainly owned better portable on-ears (Sony makes excellent phones in this category). Soundstage is very narrow and lacks body. A good value if you can get them for under thirty, otherwise I'd rather invest in a nicer pair of phones. If we're talking about value, they're a good buy compared to new stock apple buds. If you're trying to compare the sound quality of this product to serious headphones, there's really no comparison at all.Update: After 100 hours of burn-in time the sound has not been affected in any appreciable way.

I am using them with an iPod and my laptop, both sound even better than my stereo with the PortaPros. Only thing I dislike is that the hook to keep them latched together in \"travel mode\" doesn't hold all that well.If you buy them, consider getting some of the foam ear pad replacements to go with (Koss PORTABLE Replacement Cushions).

I'm pretty rough with my headphones, and these things can take a beating.  I ended up replacing a pair after 2 years, which is unbelievable in itself, because I usually go through a pair of headphones every six months.  And it wasn't because they didn't work, it's just because the wire near the jack was exposed and getting frayed.  Here are all the pros:Value:  They are a great value for the money.  I've had more expensive headphones that didn't sound as good.  Even if you don't want to spend thirty-something dollars for headphones and don't care what they sound like, I still think it would be worth it, because you won't have to replace them every six months when something breaks on them.  These headphones are very durable and aren't made of flimsy plastic like less expensive ones are, so in the long run, they would be worth it.Comfort:  These are very comfortable.  There are 2 settings, tight and loose, to adjust for different head sizes.  I've never had a problem with the ear pads wearing out or anything digging into my ears, or whatnot.  These fit very comfortably on my head (I have a big head btw) and I've never had a problem with them sliding off.Portability:  These aren't the smallest earphones in the world, but certainly not the biggest.  They do fold up if you need to pack them and they come with a little pouch to put them in.  I bring them along on trips on all the time and I've never had a problem with them.Sound Quality:  They sound fantastic!  Better than a lot of more expensive headphones.  Though any headphone with the Koss name sounds great, I think these are the best.  Just the right amount of bass and treble.  Doesn't sound tinny, or like you're playing music in a tunnel.  If you're used to less expensive headphones, you're going to hear stuff in your music you never heard before.Ease of Use:  Well, most headphones aren't hard to use, and these are the same.  The only drawbacks to these is I found it hard to adjust to loose/tight setting on the sides and they are sort of of a pain to fold up (which is why I never fold them up).  I've owned foldable headphones that were much worse though.Build:  Awesome!  The headband is metal and the casing for the earphones are hard plastic and very durable.  Not long ago, I accidently broke off one of the earpieces.  Guess what, it pops right back in!  Five stars for build!I've never buy another pair of headphones, ever.  I bought 3 pairs of these, (One for home, one for the gym, and one to replace the ones from home) and I plan to buy more in the future, if need be.  I love love love these headphones.The only slight con I can think of is they aren't 'sleek' looking like other headphones, in fact they look like they came straight out of 1982.  I don't really care what they look like though, and quality of these headphones more than make up for the ugliness.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "These are the most awesome headphones ever made!

For fun I tried connecting the Koss to my Nuforce uDac-2 HP (amp/dac) and they sound even better; mind you the Denons and Beyers have more clarity but once again considering the cost of the Koss it's worth purchasing for portable use even if you have expensive hi-fi headphones.

I was instantly defeated by the useless 4-foot cord length. I should have checked that out, but managed to miss it. Nearly every headphone designed for home use (as these originally were), come with at least five or six feet of cord-length. So right there, I was out of luck. Oh well, I thought, I can always use them with my MP3 player.My second discovery is that Koss, like many headphone manufacturers, is targeting it's smaller phones for the highly lucrative iPod market. This means that the guys in marketing are calling the shots. Not surprisingly, the phones have a cord-length that's right for the iPod crowd but not home users. Further, the sound has the exaggerated bass popular with kids into hip-hop, but at the cost of a balanced natural sound. I would describe the sound as smooth and quite pleasant, but rather unnatural. The low end is very exaggerated and the mid-range is down about 5dB. The highs are also way down, perhaps 6 or 8dB. Using my players equalizer I can make the sound acceptable, but these phones are typical of the \"bass is what the kids are buying\" school of design. Without a lot of tone control effort you should expect a bass-heavy sound that lacks any definition in the all-important midrange. I'm a lifelong headphone listener who has used Grado, Sennheiser, AKG, and even high-end electrostatics. I know good phones. These disappoint. I suspect that most of the reviews reflect people who don't use headphones much.One other point. Koss has been praised for it's generous warranty. Maybe, but read the fine print. Koss will replace or repair the phones (their option), if you provide a check for $6 and suitable packaging. Picture that. I spend $6 for repairs, $3 for a shipping box requiring a post-office visit, another $6 for shipping, and still another trip to the post-office. Some lifetime warranty.

Afterwards I noticed that pain is not because of the pressing alone but because of the high bass from KOSS. If you listen at little less volume it shouldn't be a problem.2)Mechanical issues: There are glides on the Headphone for light and Firm wear but when I put them in light mode they just don't stay there. They come to firm position once I touch the phones. One more thing, unless you pull the metal bands to the end they try to collapse. This is not an annoying problem for me because I have a big head. Slowly my ears are used to this, and I can listen for longer times and I am listening at low sound levels. So I changed my decision to return these and I am keeping them.Just to list the Pros and Cons I experienced.Pros: Best sound quality, light weight, portable, extra bass (you love it),Cons: Design not up to the mark, Mechanical issues like glides not staying in their position.

However, most headphone wires are WAYYY too long, so this is a very minor con.These are not noise-cancelling phones, and they were not purchased for use on planes (I have some foam ear buds I use for that purpose) so I can't comment on how they would work in that situation - I think too much noise would definitely get through.

Aside from replacing the ear pads once in the 5 years - they have sounded phenomenal and have provided years of good and satisfying use!  The independent reviews speak for themselves. Allow me to put it this way: Koss does not make many models of headphones,have been pulled out of bankruptcy in the 80's because of these headphones, and have not changed the design since their introduction in 1984. With that said, these headphones keep the company profitable - so let that be a testament of how good they are. Furthermore, companies do not change their designs if they struck gold - look at the German car makers and American muscle. They have not changed, have the same accents, and characteristics because you don't fix things that are not broken.Sound Quality:I bought AKG Q460s and they were horrible for the price. I had to sell those nightmares off to buy these. It served me right for considering anything but Koss. After hearing such bad headphones I missed the PPs because I am currently away. I needed these to remind me of home. These sound very well balanced, have great bass, and crisp mids, and lighter treble. I think that bass heads will not like these, but will nonetheless appreciate the sound quality and accuracy of these fairly neutral headphones. They do let in/out sound as they are padded and open air, but they are good for quieter environments and very comfortable. The open airs are better because the diaphragm vibrates freely which makes the bass sound less punchy and boxy. These are also very warm headphones with a presence of mids.Pros: Great sound and lifetime warranty.Cons: They are a little awkward because of the metal band, but you will get over it when you hear how good they are.If you are buying online and don't have the time to test them.

I like using open air headsets at the office and while taking the pooch for a walk so that I can be aware of what&#8217;s going on around me. Just when I was about to click &#8220;add to cart&#8221;, I noticed the suggestion at the bottom featuring the Koss PortaPro Headphones. I immediately remember these guys from back in the SONY Walkman days! Upon further reading reviews I decided to go for them and here&#8217;s what I think after a good amount of usage (I like to &#8220;grade&#8221; my product reviews). Hope this helps.LOOKS: 7.5 -OK, I must admit that at first I thought they looked very retro and had a nostalgic feel to them. However, as I put them on and looked at myself in the mirror, I started to feel a bit awkward and &#8220;dorkish&#8221;. That sensation intensified as I walked down the street and noticed people giving me weird looks. Honestly, I really didn&#8217;t care, but noticed it nonetheless.BUILD: 8.0 &#8211; These headphones seem well constructed. However, the thinness of the headband, which is made of an aluminum strap, is a concern. I wouldn&#8217;t want to overly bend it for sure. There are also a lot of moving parts and the ear plates are made of plastic. I would not advise to step or even sit on them. The cable is rather thin but overall, if you treat them with respect, they should be able to last and the lifetime warranty puts me at ease.COMFORT: 10.0 &#8211; Hands down he PortaPro&#8217;s are easily the most comfortable headsets I&#8217;ve worn in a long time! They&#8217;re super light so you&#8217;d hardly think they are on your head. The ear pads can feel a bit strange when first putting them on, but quickly become seamless. And they feature a slide to ease pressure, just in case. They are more comfortable and secure on my head than my old PX-100&#8217;s.SOUND: 10.0 &#8211; I proudly own several types of headphones from Audiotechnica, to Bose, to Sony and even lesser known, great quality brands. I love sound (don&#8217;t consider myself an audiophile) so I don&#8217;t take my listening lightly. These little guys provide outstanding performance for the money! The open nature of these headsets provides a very wide, warm, natural feel to whatever you&#8217;re listening to. The highs are very clear and do not &#8220;bleed&#8221; into the other frequencies. The mids are very distinctive and present. The bass is &#8220;punchy&#8221; without being overwhelming (my PX-100&#8217;s were a bit too bassy). I can listen to all genres, from rock, to hip hop to classical and equally enjoy them without adjusting the equalizer setting (flat response). Live music is definitely a pleasure to hear with these guys.FUNCTIONALITY: 9.0 &#8211; Carrying them around is rather easy. They fold into a small, tight &#8220;ball&#8221; and they fit into a little pouch provided by Koss. Getting them into this position is easy and intuitive. They fit into any bag without taking too much space. The cord is light weight and of good length. I wish the 8mm plug was bent 90 because I put my portable device in my back pocket and sticks out a bit. One little gripe that most have is that when placing them on your head, the auto-adjust process happens automatically and you hair can get caught in the sliders. Ouch! But fortunately, that doesn&#8217;t happen too often. They don&#8217;t leak sound as much as I thought they would and that&#8217;s a plus.OVERALL: 8.9 &#8211; I am a believer now! While I do not use these for commuting (subway trains) because of the inability to block out sound, the Koss PortaPros have become the go-to headset to beat while walking around the neighborhood with my dog. The sound quality and comfortableness more than make up for the hit-or-miss retro looks.

When the opprtunity came up for me to purchase a small headphone, I jumped on it.There are countless reviews here describing about PortaPro.  So I will skip most of things mentioned here.  I will just focus on my experience with it.First of all, Koss was not a known brand for me.  Only time I really saw their product was when I went to Thrifty (now Rite Aid) and saw their cheap earphones in their electronic section.  Naturally, I always thought they just make cheap quality products.  In last year or so, I started looking for a budget price headphone with good sound quality.  And this product kept popping up in reviews and people's recommendations.  I was intrigued by the fact that this product is essentially unchanged since it's launch in the mid 80's.For $25-$35 price range headphone, I am not so sure if there are better headphones.  It sounds just amazing.  Very full and rich low and mid sound (not muddled but clear and balanced).  Highs are not as strong but it is very well balanced with the rest of the sound range.Build quality is just average.  I don't mean it's badly assembled or anything like that.  But even by mid 80's standard, parts used are extremely minimalistic.  Some people commented on the metal adjustable band constantly shifting and not locking in its position.  Basically, it is not designed to \"lock\" into one position.  If you take your headphone off, you will have to readjust the length of the metal band.Another bad thing is that you just look silly wearing this thing.  But I think once you hear the sound quality, you won't mind wearing it.Again, for the price, I don't think you can beat it.*Update:  I LOVE THIS HEADPHONE!  :)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I can't Believe the sound quality on this cheap headphone!", "unixReviewTime": 1318464000, "reviewTime": "10 13, 2011"}

When I was younger, I used to buy Koss pretty much exclusively.  Lately though, I've been somewhat disappointed though with a few exceptions, the Koss PortaPro being at the top of the list!These headphones have been around since I was a teenager and unlike me, they are still going strong!  They have fantastic sound, they are not overly affected in the bass range (they don't add extra bass for the \"boom boom\" window rattlers out there), they are economical, comfortable and just all around a fantastic buy.  Also, they are recommended by SERIOUS audiophiles as the best portable out there.I can't agree with that entirely; I also recommend the Sennheiser PX-100 and PX-200 depending on your needs.  But of the three, these are the least expensive but offer fantastic sound that you would expect to come out of a pair of full size cans (headphones, I guess I'm learning the audiophile lingo!).The Koss PortaPro have the Comfort Zone temple pads that help make them even more comfortable and the pressure between temple and ear can be adjusted literally by the flick of a switch on ear side of your head.  I have a massive head and these fit me with room to spare.  I like the firmest setting on the Comfort Zone but I've tried the other two settings as well and I can honestly say that there is a difference; it is NOT just a gimmick.  The Comfort Zone really works.These are truly portable also!  They fold up into a little ball that can then be placed into a convenient case that Koss provides.  I personally would recommend buying a semi-hard shell case that Koss also sells just for the extra protection.What more can I say?  If you'd like a few other recommendations in the truly portable range, the Sennheiser PX-100 and PX-200 are rugged, comfortable and highly portable.  (They collapse as well and fit into their own plastic case.)  If you like earbuds, the Sennheiser MX-500 is wonderful with its in-line volume control; the sound is absolutely amazing for something so small.  And finally, the Koss KTXPRO1 is an excellent portable headphone with an in-line volume control.  It uses a Titanium element to drive it.  All of these are great products but ultimately this particular review is about the Koss PortaPro and I really am blown away at how great these tiny portable cans truly are.  I believe you will be too.Though I've become somewhat disillusioned by Koss as I've become a so-called \"audiophile\" (why not just call me someone who really loves good sound to come through good instead of creating a term that sets me apart from everyone else?), I highly recommend these cans to you.  If you are on a budget, you especially can't go wrong.  Remember that Koss guarantees all their cans for life with their \"no questions asked\" guarantee.  It's worth it!  So as my review title states, \"The Koss PortaPro shines in every area.\"Oh, one last thing:  Don't listen to people who say these cans are ugly or clunky; they aren't.

Both are sweet, clean and very detailed. Both are non-fatiguing. The Protapros are a bit bass heavy. On some music that bassy sound is magnificent. On other types of music with already prominent bass the PX100 is preferable. Surprisingly, the high frequencies are equally well extended on both headphones. The Portapros are a little sweeter in the high frequencies than the PX100.  The PX100 may be a little more accurate with a slightly better midrange than the Portapros.The PX100 is an up-to-date modern design. The Portapros are classics with a design that goes back 15 years!

Currently, I have a pair of skullcandy earbuds, a pair of the stock iPod earbuds and a pair of $35 Sony Studio headphones (the big over-the-ear ones).They were not working for me. The sound on the Sony ones were pretty decent, but prolonged use made my ears ache and could get very warm in the wrong climate (like...summer). They were also very heavy, so reading text books or just reading my Kindle, these things would not cut it as it would also put strain on my neck. My ears were just not made for earbuds, as I had various problems with those. The iPod earbuds failed miserably, as the sound was always too shallow for me and they kept falling out of my ears.So, I looked for the most rated headphones (not earbuds) with over a 4 star rating on Amazon and stumbled across these. Over a 1000 reviews and it still had 4 1/2 stars? Yeah, I'll take some time to check these out lol.So I got them a week ago. To avoid any \"premature\" reviewing, I let them sit the first three days with music on constantly, racking up about 36-40 hours of \"break in\" time before I tried them out objectively.First the headphones themselves. They are very, very light. The head band are a couple of thin metal bands with plastic pieces that adjust size. I like this because metal is durable but it's also light and airy and doesn't make me feel like I'm wearing a music factory on my head.The ear pads are more comfortable than I imagined. They are not dollar store ear pads (although they look that way) and are comfortable on the ears.A wildly awesome thing about these phones that people often overlook are all the parts that make them comfortable. The ear pieces themselves are hinged, so they bend depending on the shape of your ear. The metal bands are firm but flexible so it doesn't press too hard on the head or ears. Then there's comfortzone settings. It took a minute to figure out how the settings work, but once I did I was treated to a unique comfort experience. Comfortzone consists of two pads on either side that rest on the temples. The firmer the settings, the more pressure on your temples and less on your ears. I found this awesome as I could sit with these headphones on my head for 8 straight hours and feel no ear fatigue at all.Now for the part everyone wants to read: the sound. I am NOT an audiophile and I won't use any technical terms. The music sounded just plain great. I can hear bass lines in rock songs, hip-hop and rap songs thump (but not uncomfortably so). The music sounds whole and complete and not shallow and airy like iPod headphones do. The high notes sound good and even at high volumes don't cackle or distort and in no song that I listened to did anything sound muddy or wrong. The volume is well balanced. Maxed out is too loud and that's something my other pairs of headphones can't say. I've often had to max out settings just to get a decent volume on my Sony headphones. These I can keep in the middle volume range and it still sounds good.They're not noise cancelling and they leak sound. I'm okay with this because when I jog, I'd like to hear the cars coming before they hit me ;) so if you're looking for noise cancelling and quiet for others, then you should probably keep searching.All in all, for the price, I can't imagine having gotten a better pair of headphones. Personally, I love the retro style of the headphones. Keep in mind that Chucks have fallen in and out of style for 90 years and they're top sellers. This has been in and out of style for nearly 30 years and it's a top seller. I put them in the same category (and, as it happens, own both now) which is \"totally awesome\". If you're looking for some lightweight phones that sound great and have a unique look, then your search is over.

Despite being very careful, mine broke in under a year.  The stereo connector literally just pulled apart as I was removing it from the ipod one day.  The wires pulled right out of the connector.  After checking the web, I see I am not the only one to experience this.  Someone was even kind enough to post a picture of it above, in the product photos.  I still think they're great headphones and I ordered a new  pair (although I plan to have these replaced under warranty and keep as a spare).  I knocked off one star simply because now I have to shell out $6 plus shipping to replace this set (although I opted to pay $30 for a new pair to save time).  However, if the second pair breaks as quickly as the first, prepare to watch the review stars plummet.  What good is something if it won't last at least a year?*** End of update ****I've tried pretty much all types of headphones. I was looking for a good solid pair, under $50, preferably over-the-ear but not too big (for gym, athletic use and better portability).  I stumbled across these on the web and saw that people loved them, so I came to Amazon to read some reviews.  Seeing that they were highly rated here as well, I ordered a pair.  These headphones have a solid reputation for a reason, they sound great.  The minute I plugged them in, I knew why they were so highly rated.  Clear highs, deep lows.  I mean, it's not bone rattling bass, but it's decent enough if you don't want to lug around a pair of $50+ self-powered heavy headphones.  Easily the best sounding headphones I've bought the past year.  And that's in a group of Skull Candy, Sony, Apple, self powered, noise canceling... I've tried it all the past year.  The only (extremely minor) gripe I have is that I agree with others that it does feel flimsy at times.  I like that the moving pieces are metal instead of plastic (can't tell you how many plastic headphones I've inadvertently broken from simply putting on and removing), but it still has a somewhat delicate feel to it.  They do come with a lifetime warranty, which is pretty sweet, (although a further check of the terms reveal you pay to ship them back and have to include a $6 check.  Something potential purchasers should be aware of).

To tell you the truth I found the hype hard to believe for a product that has remained unchanged since the 80's . I rated these babies a 5 star for the sound quality and price it helps if you have a headphone amp if your using small devices to run them like  IPOD but not mandatory they get pretty loud without my amp and probably would protect your hearing better without it. I can tell and improvement with the amp but it sounds really good just plugged straight into the IPOD . I really like these over my VMODA bass earplugs for certain activities like exercise the bass buds sound better on alot of things without the amp especially but if you walk or ride with the buds in your hear the wire rubbing your clothes it amps up your breathing etc. plus if your walking like I do where people bike or drive you cant hear them coming up behind you , not a problem with the porta pros on. I have to point out that you can hear them if your sitting or standing next to someone wearing them so if your listening to somethiing loud and dont want to disturb others around you they dont work well for that like on a plane, bus, in a car so there are some limitations to it. people made alot of issue with the retro style either for or against. In all honesty they really dont look all that odd on your head and are quite comfy the fact that they fold up to carry in the bag is nice but they are still bulkier than a pair of ear buds. alot of people reviewd them as being studio quality monitor headphones this to me seems a bit much but they are definately on par with any headphones I tried while looking for a new set.I even felt they rivaled the bose over ear set although the noise cancelation you get from the cup does make the bose sound better on some stuff.

They deserved it. And although the crown had been taken off these by better headphones as the time went by, PortaPro's have still lot to offer and easily beat other competitors twice the price of these or more. I would not hesitate for a second to put PortaPro's above Dr. Dre's Beats (which are an over priced, mediocre sounding) phenomenon these days.Design:PortaPro's draw attention of onlookers as their signature design does look somewhat nerdy. :-) Fit is great, the temporal pads can adjust their pressure, hence alleviating the pressure put on your ears The bridge is self-adjusting consisting of two pieces sliding on top of each other, though, the plastic sleeves on top of the bridge can push into the top of your head and if you have less hair, you may feel it after awhile. Also, if you have long hair, or lots of it (not my problem), your hair could get snagged between the bridge pieces and get pulled.Cable is oxygen-free, has a 45 degree angled 3.5mm jack and splits to go into each side of the headphones. It is not replaceable, so if it breaks, you need new cans. Koss honors limited lifetime warranty, if you register.Sound:They sound as good as my AKG Q460, maybe with a touch more bottom end and a bit more of treble. Due to their construction, they do not isolate outside noise as well, so using listening to your tunes on the train or in the city with lots of ambient noise will make you crank the volume up. Beware, their bass is powerful, so treat your ear drums with some care.Listening to PortPro's at home or during a stroll in a park or quiet neighborhood is a joy.Treble, mids and bass are in a great balance, so these cans do not require much tinkering with EQ. I actually use the \"Flat\" equalizer setting on my iPod.Impedance is 60 Ohm, so you need to turn up the volume a notch or two when switching from a pair of standard 32 Ohm headphones to make PortaPro's sound at the same level of loudness.I bought them at K-Mart which was closing and they had them marked for $32.I will eventually buy the 6-pack of replacement foam ear pads.Included is a nice little faux leather pouch and can fold and fit into it very nicely, so good news for road warriors.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "After decades on the market, they still hold their own", "unixReviewTime": 1355702400, "reviewTime": "12 17, 2012"}

Those were misplaced, but I remembered them fondly. I switched to Bluetooth behind-the-neck models for awhile (Motorola over-ear) and those were great, but I forgot how much sound-quality was sacrificed by the switch. Had to buy new ones after my Motorolas were stolen, so I came back to the cord, a little reluctantly since I use them actively.Glad I went back. The clarity is fantastic. Comfort-wise, I do have to toggle the firmness down to light every time I put them on (and that's somewhat annoying) but the convenience of rolling them up eclipses that. The cord is on the shorter end at four feet, which I appreciate- I've never seen the need for long cords on headphones. If I need to use them at a desktop or something I'll grab an extender. The pouch is gimmicky and a touch small, but serves the purpose- I'll probably put them in something else. The headband can catch longer hair, but I wear a buzz, so that's not a problem. They're even more comfortable than similar models while laying down to sleep. Some people complain about the style, but I've always loved it. They're easier to wear underneath a knit hat, or in conjunction with sunglasses. The design is eternal for a reason.You really can't do better at sub-$100. If your hair is longer, wrap electrical tape around the band- it won't collapse anymore, but you won't rip your hair out. If the stock pads don't satisfy, get some Grado bowl replacements (but the stock pads are fine.) If they break, send them into Koss for a replacement, $6 S&H.; The new model has an angled plug- not right-angle, but not straight either, which I find convenient for preventing cable-breakage but might not work with some cases.A testament to how good these headphones are- my very picky grandfather has gone through several different models of headphones.

This is how long since the Koss PortaPro was introduced, and to this day, they still roll off the production line virtually unchanged since 1984. Talk about market endurance and lasting appeal. This headphone model trudged through and survived the ever evolving portable music industry, from the cassette Walkman, to the era of MP3 players and the iPod and now, the streaming era. It's baffling to imagine how one seemingly unassuming product could accomplish such a feat.One probable cause is the quality to price ratio. The PortaPros have gone up in price over the years, but still, currently at $40, they still remain a great value in headphones because of their unrivaled sound quality at this price point. Koss, for the most part, is known more for their budget headphones but the PortaPro is one audiophile secret that the masses need to know about. These pump out sound so decent, they compare well enough against headphones way beyond  their price range! In fact, I like their sound signature so much that I use them as my starting reference headphones to analyze other sets. They are the ultimate beginner audiophile headphones.So what is it about these cans that make them so great? Why are they revered by fans all over, sparking a rather vocal cult following?Seeing them for the first time, you might not even dare venture to try them on. They look like light, flimsy, cheap 80's headsets. (Which is in a sense, what they really are.) Some may even argue vainly that they are so ugly and hideous, it will be horrifying to be caught dead with them hugging your noggin. ( I find them charmingly futuristic in a retro kind of way, though. Like how sci-fi movies in the 80's imagine what future thingies will look like.)  There's a minimalist no-frills commitment to these headphones' presentation. See, there's just this mere sliding metal headband on top attached to plastic mounts that support two thin, even more plastic, grilled sound drivers, thinly wired, with black foam padding, terminating into a 3.5 mm 45 degree jack. But that same plastic mount gives the PortaPros their unique iconic look and character. It's called the ComfortZone slider and together with the metal accents, it lends the PortaPros that RoboCop/Terminator aesthetic. It was probably a gimmick back in the day because the ComfortZone settings (Light to Firm) hardly do anything for me except point the drivers outward on the light setting, resting the foams on my temples. The PortaPros, therefore, are known and remembered for this look and Koss was smart not to tinker with something that is iconic. And you don't get the PortaPros for their ruggedness or luxurious build quality. They feel so utilitarian they could be the headphones communists will finally distribute to the proletariat. They feel so delicate and fragile that Koss was kind enough to give a lifetime warranty! So basically, if you buy a PortaPro now, you are set for life.At the end of the day, you get the PortaPros because of their sound characteristics. These would never have achieved their legendary status if not for their aural properties. This is why we obsess over headphones anyway. They are not a flash in the pan fad nor are they glossed over by celebrity marketing. These are honest and straight-forward consumer products endorsed by the same consumers themselves.What you get with the PortaPros is surprising clarity and detail, you can't believe a budget headphone is actually piping it out. The drivers on these things are awesome for their price and size but they are not perfect, of course.The high end detailing sparkles with this set although treble is somewhat grainy. Bass is substantial and not overpowering but, however, could get loose in the higher bass frequencies. This low end bleeds to the the lower mids rendering it with a slight nasality. The proper mid frequencies are forward and present but they lack smoothness. Technically, with these faults, you could argue that these shouldn't sound good, but all in all, when you combine these traits, it's actually a pleasurable listening experience.I think, coupled with their specific sound signature, what makes these portable sets shine is their soundstage and separation. Since they are technically open back sets, the soundstage is unconstrained by resonance, giving them this feathery, airy feel.  Instrument separation, as a consequence, is remarkably even and it fleshes detail out. Of course, there a lot of expensive high end sets that could do this better, but if you are upgrading from entry level sets near the PortaPro's price point then the sound difference will be life changing. Like I said, these could rival or outperform headphones twice or triple their price. Some people compare the PortaPros to another open back can, the Grado Prestige Series SR80i Stereo Headphone or theGrado Prestige Series SR-60i Padded Headphones, but nothing could be more different. These Grados are excellent and extremely detailed but they skew more towards the bright treble side of things which could sometimes be too harsh for some people. The PortaPros are tuned more as balanced sets, if not bass focused, what with their slightly forward mids.  Both these Grados and the PortaPros are brilliant entry-level sets , although the SR80i are twice as expensive. I use the PortaPros, appropriately enough,  more for 80's synth pop, rock and new wave while I prefer the Grados for acoustic guitar recordings, and  if you must, do get both.So in summary, the iconic PortaPros are a 20th century wonder for their longevity and enduring appeal. Their price to sound quality and their minimalist utilitarianism is probably the main reason why they have such a following. If you dig that retro chic look and you want a quick entry to quality sound without breaking the bank, then get yourself the PortaPros now!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Koss PortaPro headphones: 20th Century Minimalist Masterpieces?", "unixReviewTime": 1335398400, "reviewTime": "04 26, 2012"}

Not unpleasant, and you won't know what you're missing until you hear it for yourself, but the expensive audiophile phones give you a sonic perspective that extends beyond your ears--far more realistic.

Swanson", "helpful": [8, 8], "reviewText": "5.5 starsFor my 200th review, I thought I'd sing the praises of one of the most useful and wonderful things I've ever owned, the PortaPro. I got these shortly after they came out, as I always longed for bass in my early Aiwa walkman (best of breed back then). These thangs changed my life!I still love music deeply, but back in school it was everything to me, my solace and balm and ecstatic release, hours and hours every day. I still wear mine daily while running the dog, walking the dog, and during various non-dog activities as well. They have tremendously balanced sound, lots of bass but very open and tight bass, not sloppy. The highs are clean and never harsh, the mids smooth and present. From Bach to the Beatles to Metallica to Charlie Parker, they deliver musical sound in a pleasingly full sound spectrum, top to bottom.For the money they are a miracle! They turn any mp3 player into a real sound machine, and BLOW AWAY any of the in-ear phones except for the thousand dollar customs (go to the HeadRoom online if you want perfect sound...they sell these alongside the best cans in the world, say no more). They deliver a surprisingly real soundstage and plenty of truly musical detail.Add to that two great features. They fold up easily and fit in your pocket (make sure to get the folding ones, worth the extra few bucks for sure), making them a perfect companion to tiny mp3 players (they are a perfect match with my Muvo 2gb player, such sound from such tiny devices!).But THE best feature of the PortaPros is the inestimable LIFETIME guarantee!! And they ain't whistlin' Dixie, folks, they mean it. I would know, as I've bought maybe four of these in the last 20 years, but I've owned about 14 new pairs total! Whenever the cords wear out or pull out of the ear (can happen, it's only thin rubber and wire, happens now and then when you're mountain climbing etc), I send them back to Koss with a six-dollar check (only gone up one buck in 20 years) and in a week I get a BRAND NEW pair. If that ain't taking care of the customer, what is?So, for coming through on their promises, and for making a truly great-sounding and very cheap-for-the-quality headphone, I give Koss total props and praise for this product, one of the best values I've ever encountered as a music uberlover. This and a Muvo 2gb player will set you back only a hundred bucks and then give you so much musical pleasure everywhere you go. I have enjoyed my PortaPros on mountain tops, inside the Louvre, Prado, MOMA, etc, by the sea, on ski slopes, on trains in the high alps with views to die for as Beethoven's Sixth took me to heaven, in the subways and busses of dozens of lands, in front of literally thousands of sunsets from Big Sur hills to Jamaican beaches to Mallorcan cliffs to Norwegian fjords and so on for twenty-plus years.I can only imagine how gratifying it must be for the spirits of the great composers to know that their music can now be heard in good sound anyplace on the planet. If we've achieved one useful thing as a species in the last thirty years, this is it: great portable sound that turns any post office line, etc from a nightmare into a dream.In fact, now that I think of it, no product I've ever purchased has brought me this many hours of joy, except perhaps some of my guitars. The Pros were 25 bucks in the mid-80s and are now only 35; with inflation it should be far more. Thank you Koss for proving that some companies still know what value is. This is a bargain of the highest degree. Whoever invented these, I LOVE you!Buy some for a friend; I have, many many times.

Excellent, audiophile-quality headphones for a decent price. So far, they've held up incredibly well over the year or so I've had them. They're very light and they haven't fallen apart or cracked anywhere at all, but still glad to have the KOSS warranty to replace them if I need to. The carrying case is a bit small so do watch out for that, but they will fit with a bit of finagling. I am a 19 year old college student, so I'm on the go a lot. I keep them in my laptop bag and they fit right in. If I decide I want to be a tool and wear them around my neck, they're nice because they automatically adjust to their smallest headband size, so they fit around the neck more like a choker necklace. I also love getting looks from people. Some comments include:\"I like your headphones.\"\"Those are some wacky ass headphones man.\"\"Those are nice how much did they cost.\"\"They sound amazing.\"et cetera.Pros:-I personally love the 80's styling.-Fold really small and are very portable. (Duh)-Come with a carrying case that feels very high quality and protects them from me.-The ear cushions themselves do not feel like the cheap foam that I was expecting, they're actually closer to Tempurpedic mattress foam, but a bit less squishy.-They (used to) automatically adjust to your head size without even having to touch them. I'll explain below.-Of course, the best thing, they sound great.Cons:-They fold small, but not flat. The headphones are still as thick, when folded, as the diameter of the ear pieces and such. I really wish they folded flat, that would make these truly great.-They don't FEEL all that well made. (But have held up thus far)-Over the course of the year or so I've had them, the metal headband part has bent slightly, but I imagine it's from the times I've tried to fold them up too small, so be aware of that, I'll explain below.-They will make your ears ache after a while (an hour or so).Meh:-I don't like how small the carrying case is, if it wasn't so well made, I'd think I was going to rip the seams or something when putting my 'phones away. Actually, it's not the case itself that's too small, as I can fit my MP3 player in the bag as well, but the opening. It doesn't open very wide. Be careful not to snag anything when putting them away.-Price is pretty cheap, but not exceptional, but I can't complain.-They don't noise cancel, but they're not noise cancelling headphones. I put this here because it's both good and bad. I like hearing my music in peace, but I also like being able to talk to my friends without having to remove my left earpiece from my ear. So they're okay for that.-They have a comfort setting on the sides, it's a switch you have to work. No, it is not an electronic switch for \"bass boost\" or anything like that, so don't get all excited. It's a mechanical switch that basically pushes the pieces against your head tighter. If you have it on the light setting and you move/fold the 'phones inward though, it'll automatically jump to the firm setting I think. It's kinda gimmicky, but it does adjust the tension SLIGHTLY. This will not prevent them from hurting your ears after a long period.So, as you can see, my cons and such are mostly about certain \"bonus\" features of the headphones. As a pair of headphones, they're the best I've ever had.Okay, so as I wrote above, there are two things I have to elaborate on:-Self adjustment: When I first bought these headphones, I could hold one side with one hand and simply lower them onto my head, and they would self adjust like some piece of alien technology. Neat. Well, it's been a while and, while I do my best to take care of my technology, all the folding/unfolding of them, due to the nature of the design, has bent the headband slightly out of the almost-perfect circle it used to be in. It does NOT look any different aesthetically, but it inhibits the little self-adjusting magical fairy gnomes from doing their job as well as they did originally. And by \"little self-adjusting magical fairy gnomes,\" I mean \"those black things on the metal headband that guide it through.\" Anyhow, not a huge deal, as it's still very easy to adjust.-Folding the headphones: As I've said above, the constant folding/unfolding of the headphones will (if you're not careful and you accidentally and repeatedly fold them up too tight without knowing) bend the metal headband to the point where it won't self-adjust as easily as it originally did. So, I'm going to help you figure out how to fold them, so you can avoid bending your pair on accident. Okay, so, it's pretty easy to do. The large plastic black pieces that hold the headphones fold inward. Fold them as if you were pushing them into your ears. They will swing into the center of the arc of the headphones about the little piece with the oval-shaped head cushions. Now, on each side of the hinge area, there is a loop and a hook. I don't remember which side is which, but you'll see it. It's the end of the metal headband. Hook the ends into the ends, and you'll have a nice neat circle. Now, you can move the little black slider pieces toward where you just hooked the headband to itself, but DO NOT GO TOO TIGHT. This is how you will bend them. I would say you can slide them about an inch and a half away from the hinge where the earpieces fold in. Now you should be good to go and they'll stay nice and folded.Anyhow, that's about all I have to say. These are well worth the money. I don't use them at home, because I have larger, more comfy headphones for that, but if I'm out? This is all I use. I generally hate earbuds, I always have, so this is how I listen to my music if I go out anywhere.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing headphones!

I am very picky about sound since I used to do sound engineering for a 8 piece band and got used to hearing a live, wide range of sound with detail that is very percise. The bass response with the Porta-Pros is natural and clean, the mids are natural and full and the treble is also clear and true. I am very pleased with these headphones and honestly the lifetime warranty sealed the deal. I remember when I was a kid in the early 70s.

They are the best headphones I've tried, particularly at this price level, for sound quality.  On an airplane, they perform better than the noise cancelling headphones I've used because they maintain the full spectrum of sound without the muffling sound I've encountered with noise cancelling headphones.  Because of the low distortion, I've been able to turn up the volume without hurting my ears to get past airplane noise.  Also, there is little sound leakage so when you do elevate the sound level, the passengers next to you won't be bothered as much by loud music.  The headphones also fold handily so they are small enough to carry for portable use.  At home, the headphones perform with excellence on higher quality playback devices so they are useful when you want to listen to music by yourself.  I highly recommend these headphones.  If asked about the negatives, I would say there are 3 things:  the headband is a bit small and a bit difficult to adjust with the clip on metal - the design of these are old and this could be improved; the cord is shorter than one would like; and finally the earpiece is covered by foam like the old airplane headphones, which deteriorate over time (but fortunately you can buy replacement foam cushions here on Amazon very inexpensively and they are easy to replace.

I read the reviews that others gave and I thought \"they can't be THAT good,\" but for the price, I didn't have much to lose.Pros-Adjustable earpieces work surprisingly well; basically, it just gives you the ability to change how much pressure the headphones put on your ears. I find that my ears get sore with most headphones, but these are very comfortable.-The adjustable headband will fit any head size. I haven't got my hair caught in it yet.-They fold up for greater portability, and come with a very stylish leather bag (probably fake leather, not sure).-The sound is fantastic, better than anything in this price range. Clear mids and highs, and decent bass that doesn't sound distorted when I crank it.Cons-No manual/directions. They weren't that hard to figure out, but a simple sheet of paper with directions would have been nice. It took me a couple minutes to find out that you need to extend the headband, then clip together the earpieces, then retract the headband to make them small enough to fit in the bag.-I'm sure the foam earpiece covers will wear out, but luckily they sell cheap replacements.-The leather bag is quite small, and the headphones barely fit inside.Overall, great headphones.

My initial impressions are (only burned in for about 10 hours).- Bass is a little too much (that's expected and is a selling point for Portapros). But with EQing, I can make it a bit better to my taste.- Sound is not too clear overall (comparing with Grados of course), but this may improve over time with more burned in (based on my prior experiences).My sources are very decent MP3 players and laptop with external sound card. No external amps were used in any way.In the end, Portapro lives within my expectations. I like them for their compact shape, portability (which Grado lacks), comfort (slightly worse than Grados). I think these are not as good as Grado Labs SR60 and SR80, if a straight comparison has to be made. Value wise, I would go to SR60 if you can buy used.

I actually hooked them up to my Onyko 110 Rms surround sound system at 70 volume level and they did not blow they did crackle but these are not a stereo headphone but close.The Koss PortaPro is the best lightweight headphone for hearing all the great variety of pings and pongs with booms for the money. The displacement with these is incredible. The sound comes in so clear and uniform you almost think your in the studio but not quite. They are worth it.I bought the Pana...screw it look above.. ok.. These are great head phones the song displacement is no where near as good as the Koss. Koss has a lot higher range than the Panasonic. The Panasonic I think were designed to give a bigger bass with less treble in the high notes but they sound the best at the highest volume. I personally like that. You listen to music loud to get into it. So you have to listen to these cans loud to enjoy them. They are very good and better than AKG M80 MK11.. for the price(10 bucks cheaper that the Koss).So whos the best.The Koss Portapro got it down in the sound department and the construction is very good. Koss also stood up to my Stereo.The Panasonic sound muffled compared to the Koss but not that much. Panasonic also can be played on your stereo and they vibrate with bass on your head..this can be annoying though. The Panasonic are built though wires won't fall out and you can depend on them on a 110 rms system to deliver the better than paid price for the sound. They are ok no Sennheiser or Grado , Sony Mdr  sound quality.I choose the Koss for my Ipods and laptops... But I choose the Panasonic for a pretty good home surround sound system.

And to be fair, I was confused. Each headset has it's own distinct feature and advantage. Very frankly speaking, the portapro's price is what I believe Koss cashing in on the hype, since frankly speaking I do not see the 50% increase in any way.That being said, the portapros do sound the best of the lot, because it feels like it has a slightly wider soundstage. I guess that is since the sportapros have a solid plastic plate almost covering the speakers, hence kind of \"closing\" it up a bit. The KSC75 have it in them to sound as good as these two, but the lack of any pressure to hold the speakers closer to the ear result in most of the sound leaking out, hence the huge drop in bass. Press the speakers close to the ears with your hand and you'll get what I mean.Comfortwise, I would say the KSC75s win by a mile. You won't even feel that you have a pair of earphones on. The pads are good, comfy, and the same for all the three, but here the lack of pressure on the ears plays to the advantage of the KSC75s.Sportapros definitely look odd. The KSC75s look uglier. Love the design idea of the sportapro though, the conversion to a behind-the-head fit is genius, and definitely a worthy option given the metal band of both sportapro and portapro being always hungry for the hair follicles around it. The portas and the sportas both come with a nice faux leather pouch, in which you can curl both of them in to a cute little ball and toss in. the sportas came with a nice gold plated 3.5cm to 1/4\" adapter as well. Packaging wise, portapro is miles aahead of the rest (well they are almost twice as expensive as the sportapros!!). The KSC75s do not have any bells and whistles in the pack, but then again it's almost 1/3rd the price of portas.The only concern in any of the three headphones was the adapter of the KSC75s, which do not have any protective ridging for the wires coming out of it, make me skeptical about the longevity of the connection.The KSC75s are the best bang for the buck definitely. But again, even the most expensive PortaPro is less than half the price of it's closest competitor from another company.But seriously kudos to Koss for making some of the best headphones I've heard in my life and at prices the others can only go green on.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Comparison between PortaPro, SportaPro and KSC75", "unixReviewTime": 1361404800, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2013"}

I was going to choose other headphones although the review on cnet changed my opinion.  There are really only two upsides to these headphones.  1)  They sound good, particularly in the low frequencies, and 2) they fold up small.  So what are the downsides?  1)  Any time you take them off they shrink back down to their original size.  You have to readjust them every time, which gets annoying fast.  2)  The things looks hideously ugly.  3)  Even though they have a setting to control how hard it squeezes you head, the pad above the speaker part rests on the side of your head and it will soon start digging into the side of your mellon.  Admittedly I have a larger than normal head, but these were very uncomfortable to wear for extended periods of time.  I finally fixed this problem by bending the metal band out (a lot).  This modification made it so they don't fold up as small anymore.  4)  There is a hook above the right ear that you use to latch the headphones closed when stored.  This hook rubs on my ear if I'm not careful, which very quickly causes pain to the top of my ear.  5)  If the band adjusts while you are wearing the headphones there is a good chance it will suck your hair into the band which isn't a problem until you try to remove them, which quickly becomes unpleasant when you realize what has happened.  As a note, my hair isn't long, in fact I keep it with a military type crew cut, so this is a problem for anyone with head hair, regardless of length.Overall, given the choice to go back in time, I would have selected different headphones.  I got these on sale, and the price is pretty good, however they just aren't very comfortable.  Bending the top band helps, but then they don't fold up as small.

First, I wear glasses, so that rules out a lot of \"over the ear\" headphones because it pushes the frames right into the sides of my head. The alternative, then, would be to use earbuds. I can't use earbuds though, because the insides of my ears are extremely sensitive due to multiple infections as a child. I didn't think I had an alternative. Fortunately, I came across these.For comfort, these things are a dream. I actually forget that I'm wearing them sometimes, which is a first for any headset I've owned. The pressure is applied above the ears as much as I'd like (it's adjustable) and I can change how much pressure is on my ears and the side of my head.Durability-wise, they *seem* to be fragile--specifically, the part where the speakers connect to the headphone frame--however I've often stuffed them in my coat pockets (yes, they're that small when folded up) where they've been squished against my shoulder bag and I've dropped them several times. It's all part of being a klutz. I have yet to do any damage to them, however. That's more than I can say about my portable MP3 player.Complaints: The bag seems a bit small, even with the \"correct\" way you put them in. I would've liked it if they made the opening a touch bigger so you could slip them in and out more easily. I've stopped using it altogether, but I use them every day for at least an hour so it doesn't matter too much for me.As for quality of sound, they've been excellent for me. I listen to a wide variety of classical, rock, and world music, and it's handled all of them quite well.

You've already read the hundreds rave reviews of the Portapro's phenomenal sound and being that I am in agreement with them all, I have little to add. I have several head phones from different manufacturers such as AKG, Sony, and Sennheiser and these beat all the more expensive open air and closed air headphones I have. The only headphones that are better are in-ear variety which I use conditions with a lot external noise such as on planes and working out at the gym.However, recently I have fallen out of love with my Portapros and I think there are a lot of Portapro users who are in the closet about this particular design flaw that I'm about to elaborate on. First of all, let me explain that I have several mp3 players. Recently, I acquired mp3 players with large amounts of flash memory (16gb). Because of the long battery life inherent in these players (25 to 30 hours), I'm pretty much listening to them all day long, along with my Portapros. I wear these instead of the better sounding isolation earbuds because I need to hear the phone and be able to talk to people while wearing them.With my extended hours of usage, I've been noticing that when I remove my Portapros, about 7 times out of 10 they pull at least one of my hairs out. I have developed a method of slow removal combined with pushing together adjustable metal frame that reduces the instance of this. This acts to release any hairs that have been captured by the sliding mechanism. However, because many times, I have to answer the phone quickly, I find myself having to pull off the Portapros at more normal speed -- and this results in too many instances of unauthorized hair removal.Because of the great sound of the Portapro, I have been will to put up with it...until last night.Last night I was at Office Depot and on a whim I purchased the Sony MDR-E828LP Fontopia Earbuds (with the wind-up case) for about 10 bucks. These are the most generic basic earbuds that Sony makes. Over the years, I have owned several of these and my experience with them was that these were entry-level headphones with entry-level sound. But when I plugged them in, I was in for a pleasant shock. These sounded great. They must of done some design improvements since I last tried them. Excellent full spectrum sound for metal, jazz, classical -- everything I listen to. Tight, natural bass response that, in my opinion, is at least 97% of the greatness of the Portapro -- all for a measly 10 bucks. Better sounding than the other headphones I have that cost several times as much.Long story short...I've switched to Sony Fontopia's for the time being. The fact that they're not \"in the ear\" allows me to hear the phone and talk to people. But best of all -- no hair pulling.I still like the Portapros for their sound. In fact a week ago, I wrote an email to Koss explaining the problem and they politely explained they were working a solution that didn't compromise the positive qualities of the current design.That's cool. I'll be waiting. For now, I've hung up my Portapros. If there are other folks out there who have a problem with hair pulling like I did, the Sony Fontopia are a nice alternative for the being.Revision 2/28/2011In recent months, I've migrated back to using my Portapros. I'm just more careful when I take them off. There's nothing else like the sound on these babies.

I bought a pair of SportaPros and wanted a second pair, tried the PortaPros as they seemed to get slightly better reviews.  Now I am wondering - what are people listening to?  The SportaPros sound so much better than the PortaPros that I have to believe something is wrong.  No depth or layering or punchiness to the PortaPros.  Portas are mostly defined by over-response in the treble range.  I'm getting sound out of both earpieces so there is not a missing channel.I've heard all about the \"burn-in\" for headphones, but the Sporta's haven't needed that and I'm not sure how much time to waste on these Porta's.  I also own a pair of Sennheiser HD238 which beat the heck out of the PortaPros but are somewhat on a par with the SportaPros.  Now the Senns seem to be sounding better with more use as I did not like them as well out of the box, but do now.  Or my ears are getting \"burnt-in\" to their sound as I think happens also.Is there something wrong with my PortaPros?  I have no idea why there would be such dramatically poor quality in a product which most people seem to rate higher or on a par with the other phones I have.** Update 1/28/11 - another thing with these phones - the channels are reversed!  Listening to \"All I've Gotta Do\" by the Beatles (old stereo, music one side vocals the other) I have 3 sets of headphones where the vocals are right channel and the music is from the left channel.  On these, it is reversed (and yes I do know how to put them on, triple checked etc).  WTH is the deal with these?** Another update - A1 Accessories is sending me a replacement pair today even though I've already lost all my original packaging and stuff.  So many thanks to them for so far great customer service.  I'll post on the new ones when they arrive.** Update 1/31/11.

I'm annoyed by Beats headphones that are just Monster headphones with Dr. Dre's name and over-boosted bass tones - but sold in awesome bright colors. Hey, I respect that Beats is bringing attention back to cans, I really do, but they're not good sounding headphones.I have a nice pair of Sennheiser noise-cancelling headphones I can't always wear due to headaches from the noise cancelling feature. Also if I'm doing activities, the Sennheisers are huge and cumbersome, not practical if I'm running, washing my car, or otherwise moving about quickly. I have a great pair of Klipsch earbuds, and those are fantastic for running. But they have poor bass response.The Koss PortaPros are fantastic, almost mixing the best of both and leaving out the extras. It does not sound as nice as the either of the above mind you, but you won't be left complaining. The bass response will destroy those of any earbud-style headphone, but you know that. Koss' drivers are more than capable of handling the meager power they receive, and they do well to replicate bass from an on-the-ear design.The downside? Yes, the looks. Hey, they're not bright-colored pastels that scream \"LOOK AT ME!\" In fact, they are ugly and say \"stay the hell AWAY from me!\" but if you're not buying headphones for the image (and you really shouldn't be), then you shouldn't care.

They are great sounding and quite durable.  They feel kind of cheap but even my 12 and 15 year old sons couldn't break them (they break or lose almost everything i get them).  The most outstanding feature of these phones is the smooth and accurate sound you get from them. I use my pair with a zune mp3 player.  They blow away the standard ear buds, as well as my monitor headphones and the skull candy headphones I bought.  The only complaint I have is the styling.  Since I'm not trying to make a fashion statement, I have to give them 5 stars.Jan. 31, 2012: I have owned these headphones for over 4 years now and I have to say I love them as much today as when I got them.  They have held up quite well with only a small problem developing at the plug end of the cord.  Where it enters the plug end the rubber has become frayed.  I remedied this with my hot glue gun.  I was going to send them to koss under the lifetime waranty but didn't feel it was worth the shipping costs.  I just bought new cushions because the old ones are quite crushed at this point.  Everytime I go to the store to sample headphones I come away thinkig these sound as good or better than the ones they have on display.  Ive tried the sony's, skullcandy's, klipshe, etc.  The only ones I like better are the more expensive (over $200) sennheisers, bose, bowers and wilkins, and audio technica.

Headphone judgments can be highly subjective, but here's one consumer's observations:1.  The PortaPros have a reputation as \"retro-stylish\" but providing cutting-edge, compensating sound quality.  My first impression upon wearing them, even before connecting them to a CD player, was that the comfort level is not equal to the PX100s.  I was highly conscious of an awkward tin band around my head and frankly baffled by the resistant 3-level \"Comfort Zone\" switch.  Admittedly, the initial sense of discomfort dissipated once the sounds of my player were picked up by the headphones.  They're indeed high efficiency (demanding less volume than the PX100s), producing an open, \"non-canned\" and transparent sound in the mid-range and offering  impressive detailing of the acoustic double bass on the low end as well as the drummer's ride cymbal on the upper end.2.  I began doing numerous A-B comparisons, noting that the PortaPros were immediately more arresting, producing bright, \"forward\" and \"instant\" reproduction of all frequencies, at times making me wonder if the PX100s weren't just a trifle muddy.  But soon the PortaPros began to sound slightly \"edgy\" and \"aggressive\"-- less balanced in their overall sound compared to the ever-pleasing Sennheisers.  Then an Achilles heel became unmistakable on a CD on which the PortaPros began to break up on the notes of the double bass unless I backed off on the volume by 50%.  With the PX100s the same CD produced only the slightest hint of distortion, which vanished when I cut back on the volume by a mere 10%.  Soon I wearied of the comparison: the PX100s had won the argument, and rather convincingly at that.  They're slightly more cumbersome to fold up and reinsert in their hard case than the PortaPro's (at least without practice), but that slight downside had never seemed more insignificant.3.  Neither of the above headphones would be ideal for monitoring or DJ work near a microphone,  the PortaPros more so because of their extreme sensitivity, which would certainly invite feedback.  For that sort of work, I depend on the largely overlooked Koss UR40s.  For comfort, frequency range, balance, and long-term wearability I would take these full-sized (but extremely lightweight) headphones over not only the PortaPro and PX100 but the Sony phones mentioned above. The UR40s handled the overly \"hot\" bass with absolutely no incident or rollback requirement.  Their weakness is shoddy workmanship (I'm on my 2nd pair): the head webbing came detached after a couple of months' use and the conducting wire is both excessively thin and short.  (If you purchase either Koss, be sure to save all of the order materials to be able to avail yourself of Koss' famous lifetime guarantee).", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Koss PortaPro vs. Sennheiser PX100 vs. Koss UR40", "unixReviewTime": 1237507200, "reviewTime": "03 20, 2009"}

You'll have no problems otherwise.2) These headphones leak sound just like any other headphone of this type.  If this bothers you, you may want to look elsewhere.  The sound leakage isn't super loud or annoying, but if you're in a quiet room and listening to rock music at a moderate level, a person a few feet from you will notice you're listening to music.Otherwise, the sound, the comfort, and the price makes these headphones worth it for anyone who is looking for a great pair of headphones.

The bass extension is very good and satisfying, much better than comparably sized phones. The overall sound is neutral and non-fatiguing so that you can listen to them for hours at a time without getting tired.One thing to note is that headphones typically are \"open\" or \"closed\" design. A closed design uses heavy pads to block out external noise and are meant for use in noisy environments. Open headphones, like the Koss PortaPros, are designed for use in quiet environments. So if you want phones for use in the subway or the airplane, these are not designed for that type of use.Another very important feature of Koss phones is the lifetime warranty. I have had my Koss PortaPros for over 10 years now. I have accidently snagged the wires and ripped one out. I sent them back to Koss with a check to cover the nominal shipping and handling charge(see their website for details), and they promptly refurbished my headphones, and even put on new pads to replace my old pads! Other manufaturers would have forced me to buy a new pair of phones. So if you expect your phones to take some punishment during use, the lifetime warranty is a big plus.Those interested in small, open style phones may also want to check out the Sennheiser PX100, which delivers similar performance, though the PX100 has less prominent bass and more mid-range; the typical Sennheiser sound. Both are excellent values but in my mind, the extra bass output and lifetime warranty make the Koss phones a slightly better deal.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent headphones for portable electronics", "unixReviewTime": 1128384000, "reviewTime": "10 4, 2005"}

I received a pair of Koss UR-20s as a gift years ago and loved them  so naturally I looked to Koss again when replacing my portable/on-the-go headphones. After buying a pair of KSC-55s, which sounded great but were uncomfortable for me personally, I hopped on Amazon and found everyone raving about the PortaPros. I figured they were good, especially considering that the design seems unchanged since the 1980s (which has to mean something), but I also figured that this was one of those things that was just too good to be true. However, these are bar-none the most amazing headphones I have ever put on my head. Listening to some of my favorite songs for the first time was one of those 'wow' moments where you realize you have found something that changes your expectations completely. The bar will be raised the instant you hear the bass response and incredible acoustic qualities of these light, comfortable headphones.I don't know what I'm impressed with the most: the amazing bass, the excellent stereo division, or how loud they can get! These things are just as amazing as most of the reviews show them to be and then a lot more... I was worried about the eighties styling, but in person they don't look bad at all. I hate headphones that scream for attention, but these don't look like that when you have them on and I have already been wearing them in public (something I didn't think I would do after only seeing the picture of them online). And even if they're a bit outdated in appearance, the design is so functional you won't even give looks a second thought after you put them on.One thing is for sure: these things have plenty of bass! Not too much (not \"boomy\"), but they seem properly tuned for listening to things without \"bass booster\" turned on, which I like. Even with the bass settings adjusted high, the bass remains clear and crisp. I'm not sure how much power these can handle without damaging them, but I listen to them very loud and they do not sound distorted or stressed at all. After a few days my left speaker began making some weird noises and it ended up being a hair stuck inside the headphones that I cleared out with canned air. Something important to consider is that these are very open and airy headphones and the treble carries very well outside the headphones (so someone nearby could definitely hear what you're listening to if you have the volume up loud).Others have mentioned that they felt the headphones were too tight feeling, but I have a very large head and they fit me without a problem. However, if I will be wearing them for an extended period of time I always set them to the \"Light\" setting on the comfortZone control (which divides the side pressure of  the headphones with your temples rather than just on your ears).I already had headphones I was pleased with (Sony MDR-G52s and Koss UR-20s) but I wanted a set of small, portable headphones for use with my laptop and these are perfect. The folding design isn't something I necessarily wanted, but it is nice. The carrying case they come with (a leatherette bag) is a slightly tight fit and I probably won't end up using it much since it is not a hard case that would protect them from shock or crushing. Some others have mentioned that they feel delicate or are easily broken, but compared to other small headphones I have had they seem very well built and equally strong considering their light weight.While I wouldn't say these are bad things about the PortaPros, it is worth mentioning that the headband is metal and will occasionally snag a hair as you adjust it on your head, and that they don't fold down as small as you might think they would so don't expect to put them in your pants pocket or something. Considering these are the worst things I can come up with to say about the PortaPros, they are nearly perfect in my book.I can't say enough good things about these PortaPros! They're simply amazing. These are the first headphones (or speakers) I've had that sound absolutely awesome without adjusting the equalizer or pumping up the bass. They sound good on everything from R&amp;B to Country and everything in-between. I've been especially impressed that they pull the bass and highs out of a song without getting that shrill, tinny treble that plagues so many headphones. If there ever was a question about the quality of Koss stereophones in my mind, these PortaPros have put it to rest and made me into a lifetime customer! If you're like me you'll wish you had discovered these legendary headphones (haha! how often is that said?) years ago...", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "You won't believe your ears", "unixReviewTime": 1083369600, "reviewTime": "05 1, 2004"}

I stayed with Koss because I had been very satisfied with these earbuds as a significant improvement over the apple earbuds for an ipod. And I was hoping for a bit of an upgrade with these headphones. But I didn't expect this significant an upgrade. When I first listened to them I was a bit overwhelmed by the bass. I had some concerns with an overly heavy bass because of some reviews mentioned this. But the more I listened, the more I loved it. I was simply hearing the bass in a way I had been missing with my earbuds. And I mostly listen to jazz with these headphones so it's not like I'm looking for a heavy rock bass here. I was just very happy to hear the bass as well defined as it was with these headphones (right now Gary Smulyan's baritone sax sounds amazingly full!).. And the rest of the sound is excellent as well. My only regret now is I'm getting used to this much bigger sound so I'm less blown away by what I'm hearing than when I first made the upgrade. But I have only to listen to some earbuds to get that &#34;wow!&#34; feeling again.Another feature which attracted me to these headphones which didn't dissapoint is their portability. I like to take my earbuds/headhones with me when I travel and don't want to lug big headhones around which take up a lot of space. These headphones fold up into a kind of ball which almost fits in the palm of my hand. And they're very comfortable to wear. The &#34;comfort zone&#34; settings come in very handy. Moving the setting from &#34;firm&#34; to &#34;light&#34; makes a difference you can easily notice in how the headphones feel. I find that I prefer the setting right between the extremes (there are three settings in all).So, unless you've got something against '80s style and are concerned that you're just going to look too wierd with these things on, they are the perfect listening device to use with an ipod (or, at least, that's what I use them with) that combines great sound and portability.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best headphones since sliced bread!", "unixReviewTime": 1361750400, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2013"}

They are a classic design from the eighties which is now nouveau chic again.I am a heavy heavy tech user and like to use high quality items and I demand a lot from them.With that said these are my new favorite headphones (the one's that travel with me everywhere).I was skeptical even after reading all the reviews, thinking \"How could something so reasonably priced really be as good as all of these reviews suggest.\" Well they can be and are, consider my doubts banished as I was pleasantly surprised. The reviews are correct, this is Koss' masterpiece, homerun, the epitome of what Koss represents.I have a pair of Bose Triport Headphones and Senneheiser PX200's both of which are excellent headphones....and these Porta Pros are commandingly better (the Triports are \"warmer\" and the Senneheisers crisper, but I like the sound of these best as they are the cleanest clearest balance of warmth & crispness).They are light weight, foldable, exceptionally comfortable and of coarse the sound quality is excellent.Actually, I cannot say enough about the sound quality, it is well balanced, full, hits the highs, lows and everything in between accurately. They produce clean scratch that pristine audio that is a pleasure to listen to. I find myself searching out music that can challenge or push these and they just keep on producing beautiful music to my ears.Essentially they are awesome. (period) They sound and function better than headphones easily two or three times their price, look cool if you're into retro and they are dirt cheap.CONCERNS:The only concerns if any are that the part that connects the earpiece to the headphone part doesn't seem very robust and may break eventually(though I haven't had any issues). Some may find that the metal headband might catch on their hair (something else I haven't had an issue with, though I have short hair) and finally, the foam pads over the earphones sort of scream I'm cheap and I will wear out on you. In defense of them, it does keep with the whole retro thing, it's really comfortable, it's easily replaceable, and they are in fact inexpensive, essentially who cares. Many of these small things have been ever so slightly adjusted on the Anniversary Edition of these gorgeous nearly perfect headphones (but for twice the price I wouldn't bother). Oh and Koss has an included lifetime warranty for the life of the product, ridiculous!(amazing) For me this tosses basically all of the concerns out the window.Conclusion:-Beautiful design and function (form and function married beautifully, just one of those products that is right on, balanced, perfect in most ways) Clearly the designers got it and knew what they were doing when they made these.-Koss' famous lifetime warranty.-Worth every penny, I would feel good about paying twice the price and wouldn't bat an eye.

The PX-100s were great, but with the success of that product Sennheiser changed the headphones somewhat and jacked up the price so I figured it was time to tryout their Koss counterparts. I'm a big fan of the PortaPros, they have punchy bass, mid-range is good and the treble is not too piercing. The result is a very good product, though I have to admit I don't like the sound quite as much as the Sennheisers. I think that the main problem is the bass, it's good, but the Sennheisers had a dynamic, fat bass sound that the PortaPros can't quite reach.  I'm a fan of a variety of music, and in rock and jazz tunes this slight deficiency is not apparent at all. With electronic music and, in particular, hip-hop, the limits of the bass show up. I should say that I do have perhaps an over-fondness for low-end sounds so it's possible that you'll like the fact that the bass isn't as strong with the PortaPros.

Downs", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "I've owned many different headphones before, including aSony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones with CCAW Voice Coil(an incredible headset in its own right) and listened to some high end sets that friends have including a set of AKG K701 Studio Headphones, and these are, easily, my favorite. I will always love my Sony MDR-V6, but due to a recent change in my listening needs, I needed a pair of open cans, portability being a huge plus. I considered the Grado Prestige Series SR80i Stereo Headphone but those didn't really look very comfortable, and aren't particularly portable. I gave these a shot, and considering their price and heritage, why the heck not?I have absolutely nothing but praise to say for these cans. They are amazingly comfortable, probably the most comfortable set of cans I own. The ComfortZone system really works, and allows you to balance pressure between the ear pads and head pads. Why Koss or another company hasn't implemented this system in newer sets is beyond me, it allows you to releive the pressure on your ears when your just kicking back and listening, or increase the pressure when you're moving around. Of course, these aren't sport phones and are less than optimal when you're very active, for that I would recommend the less comfortable but acoustically similarKoss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphones. I haven't found the headband to be uncomfortable at all, but I do have quite the thick dome of hair protecting it. You might think this would cause the hair pinching problem some have complained about, but I haven't had that problem yet. The portability is respectable, they do fold up into, as someone says, a pokey baseball. The case is pretty worthless and too small, but whatever, its really not necessary. The looks, well, are subjective. I think they're very unique and in a way personify the anti-\"Beats by Dr. Dre\" look, which in my book is a great thing, but most normal people might not agree. Who cares what they think :)And of course, the most important aspect, the sound quality. I find these sound absolutely excellent. The response is geared more towards listening pleasure and not flat response, so these won't be any good at studio monitoring or mixing, but they also don't need a ton of EQ adjustments to make listening enjoyable, unlike my V-6's. Personally I only bring up the extreme lows and highs just a little bit, and they sound great like that. Very detailed, bright, punchy, and excellent response across the entire spectrum, except for the extremely low end of the spectrum. To get solid response in the sub-20Hz region, you're probably going to have to find a closed set or a set with larger drivers. It just comes down to the limitations of physics at that point. Other than that, the sound is amazing, there's really nothing else to say. Just make sure to give them a good long break-in period.A word of warning I should mention, is not all of them come from the factory in perfect working condition. The first set I had poor bass in the left channel, in about the sub-100Hz range. This is one of those defects that's hard to detect since bass isn't directional, and for awhile I though maybe I was going crazy. I was able to isolate this by listening to each side individually (by pulling the other away from my head) and was able to deduce the problem with the left channel perfectly using that method. Amazon was great about the replacement, and my new set is perfect.My only criticism about these cans would be the way Koss packs them. They wrap the chord up so tight I doubt the kinks will ever fully come out. I observed the same quirk with the KSC-75, Koss needs to either start wrapping the chords less tight or use a more pliable rubber in the chords. This annoyance is really the only indicator of how affordable these really are. Replacing the chords with a better quality set would probably be a worthwhile mod, and one I'm considering doing. Then again, that would probably void the excellent lifetime warranty.Overall, these are an amazing set of cans. There really is no excuse whatsoever not to give them a try; they've been made the same way for over 25 years, and once you use them, you realize why they shouldn't ever change a thing. They're a true legend, and even if the price was double what it is, they would still easily be worth the money. Recommended without any reservation whatsoever.Oh and a note about the photos, the actual plug is a gold-plated straight plug, unlike the steel right-angle plug in the picture.

I view them as no-nonsense headphones. They delvier great sound but do not have the extra bells and whistles of more expensive models (as these are very reasonably priced).

The foam totally encloses the ear so that there's no sound loss or outside sound distractions. But I do have to occasionally readjust their position when listening to long movies to avoid feeling cramped. The head band does adjust but does not offer a wide range of expansion. To put this in perspective, I have a pair of PhillipsSBC HP250s that I can't wear for more than 30 minutes without getting a headache. I also have a pair of Panasonic RP-HT355S that are far more comfortable but aren't as comfortable as these.

Bose and several others qualify too.I have a bunch of very high end speakers and amplifiers rounding out at $8K for my primary system, so my ears are spoiled. See my review of AKG 702 headphones for listing of my test system and CDs. I bought the AKGs for best sound quality available for less than $1000Akg K702 Reference Class Open-Back HeadphoneMY REQUIREMENTS WERE:* Fits big noggin* Comfortable for hours of use* sounds great* less than $400* eliminates noise from dishwasher, vacuum and significant other when I am listening* For use at home in my favorite chair* No leakage so my daughter can sit next to me reading or doing her homeworkREQUIREMENTS TRANSLATED INTO FEATURES:* Over the ear cups that completely encase the ear* Adjustable headband that fits big heads, not giant* Sling configuration headbands are the best for long wearing comfort and rest on the head as opposed to clamping on the head and ears. If you move around a lot with headphones on, slings are not for you.* Closed cans, to isolate outside sounds. No leakage in or out* Long straight cable, preferably replaceableKOSS R80 REVIEWWhy R80:Same drivers as highly acclaimed Koss Porta Pro open headphones, replaceable cord, closed cans, US company made in Korea, adjustable headband, familiar name from the old days who made Audiophile quality headphones. Available straight or coiled cord.PROS* Semi sling adjustable headband* Closed cans and ear pad do eliminate leakage* Sound quality is good but not great, if the AKG 702s are a 99% of perfection, these are an 85-90%* Price, these are very affordable headphones that should last a long time* Build quality appears to be good, time is the best judge for reliability* The drivers should last forever* Replaceable ear pads and cordsCONS* Fit is good for medium and small noggins, a bit tight for my large noggin.* Closed cans and ear pads do not breath and can get very hot with a tight fit, it may be the material the ear pads are made of, possibly Koss could add some venting to the closed cans to alleviate the heat buildup*  Sound quality is good, not great; but for the price, 1 tenth of the AKGs, hard to argue with*  Sound stage is a bit narrow compared to AKG 702s and Audio Technica open and closed 700s, both 3x to 4x more money. Narrow sound stage may be a result of the closed can damping implementation and the materiel in the padsSUMMARYIn reading the other Koss reviews, if you are looking for stationary listening affordable Koss headphones, the UR40 open backs may be a very good option since they both breath and allow the drivers to move freely without damping concerns. Leakage would be a factor, but the sound stage should be bigger and heat gone.Koss UR40 Collapsible Over-Ear HeadphonesMy impression is that that from a design point of view the R80 was a good first effort by the Koss designers who should follow up by moving the R80 drivers and replaceable cord config to the R20 sling and bigger rounded ear pads configuration and offer the R80 in open and closed back cans like the AT 700. If the sling and ear pad materials on the R20 config can be significantly upgraded for a few bucks the designers should do it. Until Koss addresses the heat build up issue, they will always be at a significant disadvantage with an easily correctable problem. Koss should benchmark their Ur20, UR 40 and R80 vs the AT 700 for fit and comfort and continue to use their existing high-volume highly-acclaimed drivers.closed canClosed-back dynamic audiophile headphones, 53 mm drivers with neodymium magnet systems, 3.5 mm connector w/ 1/4\" adapteropen canAudio Technica ATH-AD700 Open-air Dynamic Audiophile Headphones with 53mm Drivers with Neodymium Magnet SystemsKoss needs to decide the target market customer for each product and clearly state the applications on their web site, commerce sites and packaging, otherwise one is left guessing what the Koss designers were thinking when they designed the unit.Simply buying the units to see what they sound like and how they fit is both expensive and time consuming. Head size recommendations would be giant plus on their web site. There must be several attractive people already working at Koss that could model their headphones on their web site with different views showing the connected equipment and applications, the cost to Koss for providing more and better photos would be $zero.  Alternatively, Koss could go all out and pay a professional photographer a few hundred for a photo shoot using Koss employees wearing the headphones and jacked into the target equipment like: i-pod, chair next to expensive stereo, next to sampling kiosk in store, sitting in an airplane pilots seat, ham radio etc.In the end, I gave the R80s to my 10 year old since her head is smaller than mine, the clamping is not as tight resulting in less heat buildup. For listening to her I-pod nano, Nintendo game and pc applications the headphones are perfect. They are her early Christmas gift. I had planned to use them with my PC but too tight and too hot, stereo and movie listening was a long shot based on the drivers that didn't work out.RECOMMENDATIONIf your head isn't big, and you are looking for some good-sounding inexpensive-headphones this might be the pair for you for all stationary applications including sitting at your work cube jacked in. Noise isolation is good. Cans don't fold and they are not echo-noise canceling so using them on the commuter train or airplane may not work. If you wear them walking around the neighborhood, make sure you have great insurance since you would be likely to walk in front of a car or truck.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "R-80 could be so much more with a little work", "unixReviewTime": 1258588800, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2009"}

I'm writing this review far, far in arrears.The sound quality is good. It's not a legitimate hi-fi listening experience but for general purposes they are good. The bass is not spectacular. It's present, but it's not what I'd call deep and rich. The treble is also good but not especially crisp. The sound quality is adequate. If you're accustomed to listening to hi-fi headphones, or a decent home system with a powered 10- or 12-inch sub, this doesn't hold up.I've had these for several years. They have been used for casual listening on the laptop, gaming, and to cover my ears while I'm mowing the lawn. So - a lot of sweat, a lot of wear and tear. They are pretty comfortable. This year the covering of the ear pads started to flake apart and peel off. There's a padded cloth beneath the plastic which is actually a lot more comfortable than the loose plastic cover, but it's going to get gross in a hurry if I keep using it for yard work / lawn mowing.Overall these are OK. OK sound, good durability. They are all plastic and pretty light, but hey, proof is in the pudding. These have lasted for years of heavy use. The drivers are still good. I've broken other pairs of headphones with no special abuse involved so this is pretty good durability. I can't say with certainty whether there are other offerings in the same price range with better durability or performance. Obviously, it would take years to do to another pair of headphones what I did to these, but overall, I'd say these are good. Not stellar. Not stellar sound. Not stellar durability. Pretty comfortable... maybe best-possible in that category. But they're not superior to a high-end pair of Sennheiser or Bose or Audio Technica headphones. They're just... good.

I could go on for pages about how much I like the sound and how they sound, to me, like much more expensive headphones. They are open style, which is not in vogue now with people who are discovering high fidelity headphones for use with a portable player, but they are very practical when you want to be able to hear your surroundings.The fit is good. But the headband is awkward. It consists of a pair of tightly curved metal bands that are bound by two plastic slide clips. You push the clips together to extend the bands apart from each other, thereby expanding the space between the earpieces. The system works and feels pretty durable to me, but it is clumsy. Or I am clumsy. Either way it is unusual. But when they are on, they stay in place, and for on-the-ear style headphones, they are quite comfortable to me. They are also very light as they are very thin, not padded (except on the earpieces) and small. These are actually really good on-ear headphones for someone who wants to jump in their headphones.I think their great advantage is their sound quality. They look and feel a little flimsy, but I think they aren't as flimsy as they look. But I don't think anyone is buying these for the look, unless they are doing it ironically. The quality of sound is the star here. I don't think they sound as good as $200 headphones, but that isn't bad, considering the fact they usually sell for around $24.For identical sound (as far as I am concerned) with a simpler and less expensive headband, I suggest the Koss KTXPRO1 at about $18.

Rivera", "helpful": [5, 5], "reviewText": "The SportaPro has a dirty little secret.The Sportaro literally uses the same exact drivers and housing as the KSC35, but instead of attaching the KSC35's clips, they attached the SportaPro headband. Here's my head-fi review 'snippet' of the KSC-35 which IS the same as the Sportapro:KSC-35, the more mature Koss clip-on that was discontinued and then brought back (only on the Koss website), for a pretty hefty $45. I'd say it's hefty because it honestly should cost just slightly above the KSC75 range, not 3x as much. They sound very similar to the KSC75. However, they are fuller sounding, with fuller bass approaching full-sized type bass, and the mids/vocals are very rich and forward. Treble is also quite neutral for me, not being too smooth, and not too sparkly. I actually am quite fond of their treble. The KSC75's treble is harsher, grainier, and more fatiguing. The mids on the KSC75 are slightly laid back, while the KSC35 presents them up front and more fleshed out. In all honesty, you can say the difference between the KSC75 and KSC35 is like the difference between the K701 and Q701. One is brighter, drier, and thinner sounding, while the other is more natural, and fleshed out.All in all, it's a solid sounding headphone, that does work very well. Bass was strong but quick due to the open nature of the headphones, but slower than the KSC75. Based on sound alone, I'd say the KSC35 is a headphone you could use for hours without fatigue. Kind of like a smaller, more bassy HD650. Nice tonal balance that I don't think anyone would dislike.The Koss Sportapro houses the same drivers as the KSC35, for less than half the price. You can literally buy the Sportapro, snap off the drivers, and snap the KSC75/35 clips on to the Sportapro drivers, and you have a cheaper KSC35. Ideal solution is getting the Sportapro and KSC75, putting the KSC75 clips onto the Sportapro drivers. This will save you $10, give you BOTH the KSC35 and KSC75 as a spare, and give the most comfort, IMHO. Just make sure to bend the KSC75 clips to place the drivers closer to the ears, as stock form may place the drivers too far, losing bass and overall sound quality.The more popular alternative, is to buy the cheap Parts express headphone (http://www.amazon.com/Mini-Stereo-Lightweight-Headphones-feet/dp/B0002KQZJS/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1371458925&sr;=1-1&keywords;=parts+express+headphones), taking off the crappy drivers, and using the headband for the Koss drivers.

And to be fair, I was confused. Each headset has it's own distinct feature and advantage. Very frankly speaking, the portapro's price is what I believe Koss cashing in on the hype, since frankly speaking I do not see the 50% increase in any way.That being said, the portapros do sound the best of the lot, because it feels like it has a slightly wider soundstage. I guess that is since the sportapros have a solid plastic plate almost covering the speakers, hence kind of \"closing\" it up a bit. The KSC75 have it in them to sound as good as these two, but the lack of any pressure to hold the speakers closer to the ear result in most of the sound leaking out, hence the huge drop in bass. Press the speakers close to the ears with your hand and you'll get what I mean.Comfortwise, I would say the KSC75s win by a mile. You won't even feel that you have a pair of earphones on. The pads are good, comfy, and the same for all the three, but here the lack of pressure on the ears plays to the advantage of the KSC75s.Sportapros definitely look odd. The KSC75s look uglier. Love the design idea of the sportapro though, the conversion to a behind-the-head fit is genius, and definitely a worthy option given the metal band of both sportapro and portapro being always hungry for the hair follicles around it. The portas and the sportas both come with a nice faux leather pouch, in which you can curl both of them in to a cute little ball and toss in. the sportas came with a nice gold plated 3.5cm to 1/4\" adapter as well. Packaging wise, portapro is miles aahead of the rest (well they are almost twice as expensive as the sportapros!!). The KSC75s do not have any bells and whistles in the pack, but then again it's almost 1/3rd the price of portas.The only concern in any of the three headphones was the adapter of the KSC75s, which do not have any protective ridging for the wires coming out of it, make me skeptical about the longevity of the connection.But seriously kudos to Koss for making some of the best headphones I've heard in my life and at prices the others can only go green on.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Comparison between PortaPro, SportaPro and KSC75", "unixReviewTime": 1361404800, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2013"}

I've change my rating to 5-star as the sound is absolutely terrific.  Compare very favorably if not better than my PortaPros and Sennheiser HD238's.I should have read the reviews more carefully and I would have seen that these are in face a double cord input and not single like I wanted.  The picture does not indicate this at all, nor is it specified in the description.  Dual may technically be better for sound than single, but for my purposes it is awkward.  I primarily use a rowing machine which means I place my player down on the floor next to me while using, then the rower has quite a bit of forward/back motion.  The dual cords hanging down in the middle make this very cumbersome, and the cord also winds up being too short, I will at least need an extender.I haven't played much with the fit, but it does seem that over-the-head is much more comfortable than trying to wear these behind the neck.  That's ok with me but I would have preferred the other.They seem to sound good, and for the price I haven't risked much, but had I known the design I would have kept looking.

Overall, they've got good highs and mids.  The 6khz treble region could be a little more pleasantly recessed than it is, but the high-end never gets  fatiguing at normal volumes - only when loud.  I must say that the bass is  a little exaggerated. It is noticeably overdone in the 30-80HZ region --  the lowest you can pretty much hear with headphones. This never *seems* to  muddle the mids, which is often a problem with bass-heavy phones. It  doesn't seem excessively boomy and there are oodles of low-end dynamics,  which I did not expect. They remind me a lot of the Denon 950's, but  without the Denon's tissy-fit highs. When I hooked them up to my Panasonic  361C portable, I was surprised even further. With Curve: Doppelganger, the  bass didn't seem even the slightest bit exaggerated. Unfortunately, when I  moved over to extreme low-end intensive music like Massive Attack:  Mezzanine, there was still a little too much bass, but slightly less than  on the Denon. Econoline Crush: The Devil You Know kind of had too much  bass, but most people would probably prefer it that way. Yet, on many CD's  bass is noticeably overdone.  Spatially, the SportaPros have a nice open  sound.The SportaPros fold up and this is where the other caveat comes  out. When using the headband behind your head, the little fold-up hook can  start rubbing against my head, behind my right ear. This only happens when  the band slides too far down, though. All Koss had to do was have the hook  facing the opposite direction to avoid this. They're still the most  comfortable headphones-that-press-on-the-ear that I've ever tried, and I do  love how they fold up; it returns them to a nice, taught shape. The Koss  has a good, short length of cord for portable use that also has a mute  button on it.I'll keep the SportaPros as a portable and bass-y  alternative. If used with bass turned down a tad, they would be even  better.P.S. Single-entry wires are not superior.  They allow out of  phase cross-talk to enter the opposite ear through the shared ground wire,  which is why audiophile headphones are almost always dual-entry.  The  classic Sony V6, for instance, has a cross-talk problem and is unsuitable  for binaural applications because of this.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good For The Price", "unixReviewTime": 963360000, "reviewTime": "07 12, 2000"}

The spring-type band forces them against your ears which will always help bass reproduction in phones. On the down side, this could cause fatigue after long periods.They fold up, quite ingeniously, to a very small package, and the leatherette bag plus gold connectors are nice extras. I don't know what the fuss is about their looks -- I don't think they are particularly ugly, and least on my head.

(Nothing wrong with the quality, just I like to have one pair at home, one pair at office and another pair stuffed in my backpack)It looks fragile and sometimes ugly. But what really counts is the sound. The characteristics of the sound are: clean, warm, dynamic (overs a wide range from low to high), very good sensitivity (very loud at normal volume setting), lots of bass (although a little boomy at times). The first time when you hear it you will be surprise for its powerful bass. I hate the mute button but I heard recently Koss had taken it off. For protable use it's probably the best in its price class. Some people complain about the comfortability issue, I have no problem wearing it for hours though.For more serious listening, I would highly recommend a pair of Grado SR60 (open style). It's about $70 and I couldn't believe how much pleasure I had taken from listening to it. The highs are crystal clear, the bass is good but not boomy at all (you can feel it), the warm, open mid range is simply seductive. The transparency and spacious of the sound stage is amazing. It stirs up your feelings and emotions when listening to most vocal, classic and pop music. It's pity that Amazon.com doesn't carry this headphone, truely a gem in the protable headphone family.Another pair (closed style, around $70-80) I could recommend is Sony's MDR-V6.

I purchased this product to replace a Faulting ADC 215 Equalizer. This was the only choice on the market. After getting the unit I was able to connect it quite simple in to my system. I have a DBX unit for my Reel To Reel and had to connect it directly to the Reel To Reel, not much of a problem. But then the problem started to unfold. First the buttons, They are confusing, and don't work half the time. Then I noticed that I could not monitor tape recording output from Three head Deck and DBX record monitoring. With the EQ connected to a deck that monitors it seem to short the input to the output, causing the input level control not to respond, not distortion but not good for you tape deck. After that I started tested a different configurations. I have a 2 Head deck, So I connected it to the EQ 200 and it worked okay, but still had problems with the buttons happened again. I then connected the Reel to Reel without DBX, direct bypass the monitor loop and it worked okay for the first few times, then all of a sudden I could not record on the Reel To Reel, the input controls didnot work and the signal to the meters were pegged, not good, then I losted the 2 head deck. Powered off everything and tried again. After several reset everything worked again. So I decided to give this unit one more try, by adding one piece at a time and testing one piece one piece at a time. I added the Three Head Deck (Teac V711), to Tape1, then tested, worked okay for a while and then things started not working. Remember this is just 1 TAPE DECK !!!!!! connected. Powered off all components and things went back to working. I said okay maybe it is me let me read the manual more closely. Figured out the button (Tape 1>2/Tape2&lt;1) button depends on the setting of the (Audio/Video) button and also the (Line/Tape) button so to listen to Tape Deck 1 you must have Tape1>2 + Audio/Video + Line/Tape LED Green. Okay that worked, only for about and hour and then same problem happen, input controls stop working and meter pegged and again this is just 1 TAPE DECK CONNECTED !!!!!.What I have found out after opening the unit and putting it on a Oscilloscope, I found that the contacts in the switches are very poorly made and are solider to close together and are causing electrical interference. When a button is depressed and testing the contacts on the Oscilloscope showed a little ambient noise -75dbm level, which is okay, but as you use the switch the noise level increases until it shorts, that is why when you power off and let the unit sit and power back on it works okay that is kind of a electrical discharge so to speak and the ambient noise is back to around -70 ~ -75dbm. The open circuit test fluctuated from inf to 10K ohm resistance. Closed circuit test revealed from 0 ~ 1 ohm resistance on average but fluctuated to inf at times. That why the sound cuts out and the input shorts to the output.So all in all the unit went back for a refund. Please don't buy this unit. It is low quality and poor craftsmanship that it will not last more than a month or so. It does not support tape monitoring, and don't try to connect a Three Head Deck it will short out your Deck. The buttons don't work and short constantly. Tape to Tape dubbing is limited to only monitoring source, THAT IS CORRECT, when dubbing you can only list to the source Tape and not the dubbing tape to insure that the deck is recording okay.

After reading another review saying their unit worked fine with no button problems, I decided to take a chance, hoping that the other reviewer's button problem was an isolated incident. Wishful thinking. I've had the EQ 200 for about a week and the same problem showed up on mine. I was listening to an old album on my turntable when one of the stereo channels just cut out. At first I thought it might be a loose cable, or worse, a problem with the cartridge on my turntable. Then I remembered the review about the \"sticky buttons.\" Sure enough, I went to the EQ and jiggled the buttons, and the sound cut in and out as I did so. After jiggling them a few times the problem went away for a while, then it out of nowhere started acting up again. It's not so much that they \"stick,\" as it is that they just plain don't work properly. The have a \"cheap\" feel to them; all the switches appear to be mounted to a single flimsy bracket. When you press one switch you can see the adjacent ones move. Besides the fact they don't work, they are confusing and limited the way they are formatted. They don't let you monitor the tape deck's output when recording; something that should be a standard feature of an EQ. The buttons on my old Radio Shack/Optimus EQ made a lot more sense in how they operated for dubbing/monitoring. There are a couple other annoyances on the Audio Source, too. The analyzer display has no sensitivity adjustment; when I play my CD player, the display is just maxed out. You can adjust the display by turning down the input level knobs, but I only want to turn down the display, NOT the volume! The \"0\" line on the EQ should be a different color for easily identifying the relative position of the sliders, but it is simply white like all the lines, which makes it difficult to easily identify the center line. If I were keeping the unit, I would take care of this problem with a magic marker. There are also no scale markings on the input level control knobs, leaving you to guess as to when you have the left and right balanced. The sound quality seems decent when it works, but what good is a stereo component if the sound cuts out while you're listening to your music? The illuminated sliders and spectrum analyzer look neat, but hey, I don't buy a stereo component just for looks. Seeing as other people have complained of the same button issue, I'm sure Audio Source has to be aware of the problem. Obviously, they are not going to invest the resources to correct the problem on something as obsolete as a graphic equalizer. It's too bad, since this model seems to be pretty much the only EQ left on the market for a home stereo. The only other EQ I found other than professional models for rack-mount systems, was a TEAC model which doesn't have as many inputs as the Audio Source. I am returning the Audio Source for a full refund; no sense having them send me another one when undoubtedly it will have the same defect. I guess I will try my luck with the TEAC, either that or put up with the muddy sound my stereo has without an EQ. I will just have to do the old cable swapping routine if I want to do any dubbing with the TEAC.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "JUNK", "unixReviewTime": 1170288000, "reviewTime": "02 1, 2007"}

It wont spoon feed you when it comes to learning, which will really help you in the long run.  In the age of \"press this button and you're focused\", this camera is one of the few 35mm's left that doesn't have AF.  Also wont change exposure levels to what the camera suggests(such as AV or TV mode some cameras have), this gives you the freedom to be creative as some shots have a whole different mood if underexposed a stop or overexposed a bit.  As for manual focus, it's something you need to be able to do as a photographer.  Sometimes the computer in your camera just doesn't focus perfectly on that eye you want in focus, or for something as precise as macro photography which has very shallow depth you're going to need pinpoint accuracy that a computer can not do for you.This lens is great because it's like the vintage 35mm except you don't have to worry about the light meter or any other small part inside of it being broken.  Nor do you have to worry about the image quality.  The kit lens in this camera is very sharp.  It's a bit limiting considering it's f/3.5 so that rules out really low light(but grain can be good, unlike noise in digital; grain has an artistic quality), but considering the price and the quality of the whole kit it's great.Sure you can get a used one from the 70's or 80's for way cheaper, but chances are something is broken in that thing and you may not know until you've invested 2 hours developing the first roll in your class...So shell out a little bit extra and get this, it's worth it.edit 12-9-10:I still like this, shot some street photography with it since it's really compact compared to a big DSLR, but one big con I've found is build quality. It's got a lot of plastic, and I did drop it once which resulted in a huge dent. The silver parts look metal but they aren't, they're some sort of chrome paint covering more plastic. I don't baby my gear so this thing's starting to look kinda ugly.  It hasn't completely broken yet though.

,{"reviewerID": "A28B1DZ3CLMCYI", "asin": "B00001QHP5", "reviewerName": "Raz", "helpful": [7, 7], "reviewText": "Like many online reviews and even Wikipedia describe this camera, the FM-10 is a entry level film camera. Still, even though it lacks any kind of automation and (more important IMHO) a ground-glass pentaprism viewfinder (extremely important for depth-of-field preview with lenses faster than f/2.8), I believe that this camera is as good as any other SLR film camera. Furthermore, I doubt that any beginner or even more serious amateur photographer who would choose film over digital, has a desire for high automation features in such a camera. The FM-10 (manufactured by Cosina in Japan and sold under the Nikon brand) has a built in light-meter that requires two small batteries (provided with the camera) and is operated by a separate button on the slightly upper left side of the lens. Operating the meter button does require a shift in what would be the most natural and safest left hand grip of the camera, so that holding the camera in a steady position while using the light meter button becomes a bit uncomfortable, but that probably only goes for people with smaller hands like myself. Since most modern light meters suffer from a  biased factory calibration (meaning they would fail the grey card test), I am yet to run some appropriate tests as to check the accuracy of this light meter's calibration. On the positive side (and the right side of the camera), the depth-of-field preview button/lever, although not useful through the entire aperture range as mentioned above, is in a comfortable position and does fulfill its purpose at apertures starting from f/4 up. Although built on a metallic frame, the camera's body is mostly plastic. Personally, I don't think it feels cheap (no squeaky noises during handling) but I do feel like exercising caution at all times when handling it or placing it on hard surfaces, and I will think twice before taking the camera out in the rain, mist or extreme cold weather (I wouldn't care with a 35 yrs. old Nikon F1), rolling in the dirt or sand for nature close ups, etc. The camera case, although not made of quality leather as you might expect from a Nikon camera (but again, this is NOT a Nikon built camera), does provide a reasonable level of protection, except maybe for the top edges of the camera, where the attempt to leave the strap hooks come thru, has left those areas exposed to dust and other possible external damaging factors. It is also a bit awkward to remove and put back on because its edges always rub harshly agains the focus ring of the lens, which in time might create marks or even damage, especially on a plastic built lens like the one that comes with the camera. I would suggest looking for an older (much tougher and better built) leather case. The lens that comes with the camera is rated one of Nikon's worst lenses (check out Ken Rockwell's reviews for more info), but that doesn't mean you cannot take any pictures at all with it. A lens choice is always a matter of personal taste, as well as an educated choice for some users. The day I ordered my FM-10, I have also ordered a Nikkor 50mm f/1.2 manual focus lens, a mechanical and optical masterpiece suitable only for fully manual film Nikon SLRs at an unbeatable price compared to similar lenses built for digital or automated cameras. I have removed the bundled lens without even removing the lens cap and replaced it with the 50mm (much heavier as it is all metal built). For those who are not willing to &#34;waste&#34; $6-700 on a new fixed lens, I would suggest the older Nikkor 70-200mm AIS lens. You probably won't be able to find a new one because they don't make them anymore (as opposed to the 50mm above that you can get brand new), but you should be able to find one online in very good condition, anywhere between $100 and $400 depending on the seller. I got one for $220 in mint condition on eBay. Remember, the lens is the most important part of your camera and the decisive factor in the overall quality of your pictures (apart of course from your aesthetic and artistic feel). It remains to be seen how the not-so-high-quality of this camera will hold over time, but unless you want to go for one of the much older, bulkier (but better built) genuine Nikon SLRs, then the FM-10 is a good choice for the money, even if I consider the lens completely useless (that's just me). The reason why I didn't go for an old Nikon is because I couldn't find one from a reliable source. All sellers claim their old Nikons to be in perfect or good condition, most of them actually being completely unaware of any possible problems. Unfortunately, the slightest mechanical issue in an old Nikon SLR is very hard to detect, even harder to fix or re-calibrate, and ultimately renders the camera unusable (i.e. a slight shift in exposure time). With the money I'd pay for a defective Nikon F1 (rated in good condition) and having it fixed, I'd get a new FM-10, a leather case and some lens filters. Overall, even if I don't feel the same confidence (yet) as I used to with my old Zenit 11, I am happy with my new purchase and will try to get the best of it for as long as I can. I hope this helps you make the right choice for you.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good but not great", "unixReviewTime": 1353024000, "reviewTime": "11 16, 2012"}

Now, the prices have dropped so much that the same review would be more applicable to a 128 or 256 MB card. - A.I.Nobody would argue that the more memory you have in your digital camera, the better. The question is what the reasonable compromise between the price of a memory card and its size is, and how to predict how much memory you actually need before you paid for it. I looked up some literature on the image compression techniques, and made some experiments with printing out pictures with different resolution and different compression ratios, and came to the following conclusions.Most cameras offer a choice between several picture resolutions and several image compression modes. Low resolution is good for on-screen viewing, while high resolution is better suited for printouts. It is not uncommon for digital photographers to take pictures at a resolution lower than the maximum allowed by their camera, although there seems to be no point of buying an expensive high-resolution camera to take low-resolution pictures. A probable reason for that is that their camera was shipped with a very small memory card and did not upgrade it yet. Unfortunately, high resolution images require lots of storage space: an uncompressed image taken by a 3 megapixel camera can be as large as 10 MB. JPEG compression, which is based on an algorithm specifically developed for image compressing helps to store large pictures in relatively small files. Specifically, JPEG compression algorithm divides an image into squares 8*8 pixels each, performes two-dimensional discrete cosine trasform of each of these squares, and compresses their frequency spectra by removing the high-frequency components or by decreasing their accuracy through a \"quantization\" procedure. While this review is not appropriate for a discussion of technical details of the JPEG algorithm, it is worth saying that JPEG analyzes each small \"brick\" of the image individually and adapts the level of smoothing/compressing to the image to be compressed. In fact, you determine not the size of the compressed image, but the level of its quality: the final size of the compressed file varies depending on each particular image. This \"adaptive\" nature of JPEG makes it very efficient: it takes advantage of the smoothness of monotonically colored parts of the image by achieving great compression ratios in those areas without significant losses in quality, and it is also good at rendering sharp contrasts in the image. Since JPEG standard was optimized to take into account the specifics of our perception of visual information (like mp3 compression of music files takes advantage of the way how we hear music), JPEG compressed pictures are almost undistinguishable from the originals up to the compression ratios of 1:8 to 1:12.Therefore, a combination of highest possible resolution of your camera with the \"fine\" (or \"best\") compression mode is a good choice for a digital photographer. If this combination of resolution and compression is used, a 32 MB memory card would be sufficient for about 36 pictures taken by a 3 megapixel camera, or for about 48 pictures taken by a 2 megapixel camera. This is equivalent to one or two rolls of film, which is not a lot, but usually suffices for a day of occasional shooting. Hence, it seems to me that a 32 MB memory card is a good buy for the most of us.Just the last comment: note that there are two types of memory, flash and SmartMedia. Check you camera manual which one you need. SmartMedia memory cards are slimmer, if I am not mistaken.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "a good compromise between price and memory size", "unixReviewTime": 961113600, "reviewTime": "06 16, 2000"}

Not a lot of bass, but some pairs at this price have barely any bass. The mids on this pair are emphazised (but not by a lot, props to Sony). And they do have a good, clean sound to them, so even if you are unhappy with the low end of these earbuds you at least have a good upper end.For other aspects of the earbuds, they are very comfortable and fit much better than the Apple earbuds, but feel better with the pads. I have already lost the pads but still fit fine and are still comfortable for long periods of time. Also, these are some durable headphones so far, and after a half-year of use they still put up nicely.Overall, not a bad pair of esrbuds for portables. Already got a better pair?

Highs and mids are decent while bass lacks a bit.  Construction is really durable, I like how there's no exposed cable other than where it runs to the player.  If you fall asleep with headphones on like the Panasonic RP-HTX7-W1 that have an exposed cable above the earcup you'll likely form a break in the cable from sleeping on it.  Not so with these cans.  Also the cable is nice, thick, and it's coiled.The BAD:  It's almost impossible to listen at an enjoyable volume and be polite.  Even at just 50% volume on my Zune people across the room can hear what I'm listening to.  This is a big reason I don't like these.  If you don't care if you annoy people I guess it's ok.They can get uncomfortable in long listening sessions (like after 45 min or so), sometimes near the end of an album I have to take a break.  The headband or whatever that holds the cups to your ears is just too strong/tight for an adult head.  It's fine for short sessions.I actually had a pair of Panasonic RP-HTX7-W1 before these.

The earbuds just weren't hacking it, even though the pair I have are quite good.  The jet engine noise finally got to me.I have an old pair of Sony MDR-M77 headphones which are quite good, but I wanted something new.  So, I studied what was available and settled on the MDR-V500DJ headphones.  After purchasing a pair, I regret my choice and I am returning them.When I got these headphones, I immediately plugged them into my iPod and picked a favorite cut from XTC (Mayor of Simpleton).  As I listened to the song, I kept wondering what was wrong,  Then, it dawned on me, the treble was entirely muffled.  I grabbed the MDR-M77 and did a A-B test with several tracks.  Same result.  The MDR-V500DJ has little or no high-end.  Just as a sanity check, I grabbed my Sony MDR-V6 phones and did the same test.  I consider the MDR-V6 one of the best headphones ever made by the way.  Yeah, the bass was definitely richer than the MDR-M77, which seem bright in comparison, but both were much closer to what I expected than the MDR-V500DJ.I thought it might be the iPod, so picked a coupled of CDs (MFSL Dark Side of the Moon & Bernstein in Berlin-Beethoven Symphony no.9) to try in my portable CD player.  Same result.  While the MDR-M77 was the brighest of the three, the lack of high end on the MDR-V500DJ made neither CD sound good.  Once again, the MDR-V6 was the best and most balanced of the three.Still seeking the perfect lightweight headphones, I went to a local Magnolia Hi-Fi to try a better comparison.  I tried both noise cancelling models from Sony, several Sennheiser models, the MDR-V600, MDR-V500DJ, and MDR-V300.  First of all, forget the noise cancelling models.  None of them sounded as good as MDR-V500DJ.  The MDR-V600 was the best of them all and reminded me of the MDR-V6 (which I understand they replaced).  The MDR-V300 is definitely better than the MDR-500DJ by a long shot, and I would say the MDR-V300 is comparable to Sennheiser HD-212.  I am going to try them side-by-side at home soon.Although many of the Sennheiser phones sounded good, they seemed over-priced compared to the MDR-V600.  The only one that was close in price and quality was the HD-280.  By the way, the HD-280 was uncomfortable and put a lot of pressure on my head.Unless you like listening to bass only, do not buy the MDR-V500DJ headphones.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Muddled high-end for this price!?

And by DJ, I mean the live-performance variety, not the studio-technician variety.And, for DJs, these headphones are excellent.The actual physical configuration of the headphones is clearly designed for DJ use, with easily folding, individually rotating cups for single-side monitoring.  They are also designed to rest close to the ear which, although it may make your ears hot and uncomfortable if you use them for prolonged home listening, is ideal for DJs because they effectively cancel noise up to extremely high volumes (I've used these in both a small party and club setting, and have found the non-electronic cancellation to be more than adequate for both).The actual sound styling is typical of Sony, with the quality generally reflecting the price.  I listen to a variety of music through these: in addition to hip hop &amp; house for club use, i listen to various other electronica, various rock, lots of acoustic music and a ton of a capella.  The headphones perform admirably in all cases.  The bass is strong without being overbearing, the mids are balanced and the highs are clear without being ringy or piercing.Please note my initial admonition again, however: these headphones are designed for DJs.  For your money, you can probably find a better set for home use by Sennheiser, or similar, which aren't geared torward performance/studio use.  In addition, other reviewers are right: the headphones get uncomfortable after prolonged use (I found that after about 30 minutes to an hour of home use, I felt the need to take them off and massage my ears for a bit, as these fit tight and are a bit heavy).  The only reason I would ever recommend against these for DJs is if you plan on spinning for an extraordinarily extended period of time, because they are slightly heavier than the v600s and the extra weight, while usually unnoticable, can become an issue if you're spinning upwards of five or six hours.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "great for DJs, for whom they are intended.", "unixReviewTime": 1041984000, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2003"}

They are quite comfortable too!Use caution when buying these headphones used or on ebay. There are a lot of imitation chineese ripoff brands that are exceptionally cheap in build quality in comparison, but look like a very good counterfeit.

I'm an amature DJ and could only recommend these for DJ use.1st of all, the major complaint about these headphones are the cracks that appear on the swiveling brace.  Face it, it's plastic and it can break.  And it's not the best design for durability.  But it's not gonna happen to everybody.  As a matter of fact, a lot of record stores with turntable sampling stations will have these headphones out for use.  A local record shop in HB had about a dozen of these headphones out for years of careless use.  I think, most people end up sitting on or packing them in heavy luggage.  I can't see how you can just put these on top of your head and break them.2nd, they're not designed for audiophile sound quality at moderate volumes.  They're designed to monitor the next song while listening to blaring 15\" club speakers.  A device with mediocre output voltage will not move these 50mm drivers well enough to get good sound quality.  So stay away from iPods.  They're just not gonna drive these headphones really well.  Imagine hooking up two 12\" subwoofers to your car and trying to power them with your headunit.  It's not gonna happen.  Like I said, these are specifically designed for DJ's.  I use a Vestax PMC-05Pro2 mixer and I get crisp, studio monitor quality sound.  Very transparent and smooth lows.3rd, as for the 50mm drivers.. these headphones are designed for accurate and distortion free playback at loud volumes assuming you have a clear and strong output.  There are other headphones out there that have 50mm drivers that are designed for moderate volume levels.  A lot of it is going to depend on the sensitivity of the drivers.  Usually, lower sensitivity will handle louder volume levels better but a higher sensitivity unit will sound more accurate at lower levels.

It's definitely very worn out--the (replaceable) padding is cracked and the fit feels a bit loose--but, they still sound great and the joints have not broken off again.

The problem is that it is now a bit looser so it falls off from my head even more frequently.

I have been looking to replace these and I found the new pioneer hdj-1000 to be a possibility. It sounds just as good, it is definitely lighter and stays on the head steadier; and even though the construction is similar in that it is plastic, the swivel joints are built differenly from the V700DJs which makes me think they knew about this SONY's problem and they have found a way to prevent the joints from cracking.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great at first, but falls apart; then glued back on and going strong after 12 years of use!", "unixReviewTime": 1083542400, "reviewTime": "05 3, 2004"}

Music no longer feels like it's around you, you're part of it.  Bass sounds absolutely crisp and clean, not muddled and washed out like some other headphones I've used.  Highs and midtones are well represented.  Pretty much perfect for any sort of music, be it electronic, rock, or classical.  I used to game with these headphones on my PC as well, which completely spoiled me.But like others have said, wear and tear seem to plague this pair of headphones.  I don't DJ, but I do use my headphones on a regular basis and my first pair eventually formed cracks near one of the earpiece joints which was the beginning of the end.  My second pair's demise was my own fault, having fallen asleep with them on and somehow twisting them in just the appropriate direction to break off a joint.Other than the joints, however, I'm pretty happy with the ear pads.  Given the amount of wear, the pads have held up quite well, where other cheaper headphones have eventually fallen apart due to heat and perspiration.Comfort-wise, I'd rate them a 4 out of 5.  They feel pretty much like what they look like.  Part of the great sound is because they pretty much cup your head pretty snugly and feel pretty comfortable for the first several hours.  However, after an extended period, your ears are ready for a break from being mashed to your head.  I don't rate them too badly on this, mainly because there are other similar-looking headphones which are pure orture compared to the Sonys.If you're looking for comfort, I would suggest the Bose Triport headphones which sells in a similar range or the more expensive Quiet Comfort 2 (which adds Noise Cancelling).  Although I can't speak for wear'n tear, I've tried out the Triports at my friends place and I currently own a pair of QC2 (mainly because I needed noise cancellation for work-related reasons), and these two pairs of headphones are unmatched for comfort.HOWEVER, for pure sound, I preferred the Sony's by far.  I'll probably pick up another pair of these Sony's soon, because writing about them make me miss them.So my bottom line?PROs:1) Sound - my favorite sounding pair to date by far!2) Portability - they fold up nicely and come with a travel pouch3) Comfort - reasonably comfortable for extended periods4) Durable Ear Pads5) Sound6) Sound7) Sound8) Sound9) Sound10) SoundCONs:1) Quick wear'n tear on the plastic joints, so careful with twisting the earpieces too much2) High price for such fragilityFor such an pricy pair, Sony should have constructed these headphones better, but at least for me, the sound is definitely worth it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "First-rate sound!

Edwards!", "helpful": [8, 10], "reviewText": "This review is to address the issue of these headphones breaking, and only that, because quite frankly I could go on for days about how well these headphones work for DJing and everyday listening.  Stuff breaks, this is a fact of life.  Cars break, dishes break, and even people break, these headphones are no different.  Expecting them to last a lifetime because of the pricetag is simply naive.  There's also a difference between breaking beyond function and a simple annoying break like the plastic cracking.  These headphones will surely enough one day die completely as in loss of function, but up to that point they will begin to fall apart.  The swivel housings are the most common thing to break but from reading the reviews here on Amazon it is as if people have never heard of Duct Tape or they are so appalled by the idea of $100+ headphones breaking that they refuse to do anything but complain about it.  The Pioneer HDJ1000s break, the Senheisers break, and if you can find me headphones that don't break then I applaud your discovery of solid titanium headsets that don't exist.This all boils down to one thing and one thing only, how well do you treat your possesions?  If you're like me and you don't mangle everything you own then a $80-$150 pair of headphones is a safe investment, because it will last.  If you just play wild shows all the time, wear these skating/snowboarding, throw them in your backpack, or whatever then you're a moron to buy them and expect them to not break.  Nowhere in the description of this product does it say these things are as solid as a tank.  It states that they're flexible (they are), have a good bass range (they do), and they're comfortable (they are for me but that's a personal thing).Don't be deterred by reviews saying these things break, because everything does and every comparable set of headphones is equally flawed.  The HDJ1000s get loose sliding fixtures really quick, the Senheiser 280s sound overall better but they feel like a plastic toy and really aren't much better.  If you're a DJ your options are the V700s and HDJ1000s, there's a reason they're the industry standards.  They are time tested and proven.  If you aren't willing to buy a few good pairs of headphones then DJing is NOT the hobby for you because you WILL break your stuff MANY times, not just your headphones.Well there's my rant, these headphones do EXACTLY what they say they do and for that I give them a 5/5.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "People will whine about anything...", "unixReviewTime": 1183939200, "reviewTime": "07 9, 2007"}

It has no funny hissing or such.I am not a earphone guru like some of these reviewers.

The CD has a range of frequencies, from deep bass (down to as low as 20 Hz) to mid-range.  Also, since I travel frequently, the headphones need to be sturdy.When my previous headphones (by Sennheiser) died, I purchased these to use for the CD instead.From an audio quality standpoint, with my old Sennheiser headphones, I could hear some subtle nuances in the audio, at slightly lower volume, than I can with these headphones.  Then again, the Sennheiser headphones cost $250, while these cost $70.However, my Sony headphones serve me very well.  They produce good (but not great) sound, so I can clearly hear the bass and mid-range without turning up the volume.  Because the ear cups are soft and comfortable, the top is padded, and the headphones themselves are lightweight, I can easily fall sleep with the headphones on.The coiled cord is extremely handy, keeping the headphones from becoming too tangled.Beyond that, the headphones themselves are sturdy, standing up to a year of being put in a squished suitcase without a scratch.  Also, they are very affordable (about $70 from Amazon.com).The only issue is, if I wanted headphones to use while working out, these headphones wouldn't do because the padding would likely absorb my sweat.  However, for my non-workout needs, these are excellent.Although the audio isn't quite professional quality, these are an excellent set of headphones for the money.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Solid value in headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1242172800, "reviewTime": "05 13, 2009"}

The coiled cord is about 5 feet long or so and stretches out nicely.  Sony's page says the cord is 9.8 feet long, extended.

Do your research, Sony is not even close to being in par with the best headphones manufacturers like Sennheiser, Grado, and AKG.  These brands are, in my opinion, the best in the business.  After listening to jazz with my AKG 702 and switching over to the Sony, I feel like just throwing this piece of garbage on the wall like really hard.  The sound coming from it sucks so bad in comparison with my AKG.  Don't believe me?  Read all the bad reviews in any review web site, not just this site, and you will hear the same thing: muddy.  Sony headphones sound muddy.  I own 3 Sony headphones and they all have the same characteristics: loud, muddy, and bassy.  Now 1 and 3 are not bad qualities, but 2 is just unacceptable for anyone looking for good sound.  Now these will for sure sound better than really cheap portable headphones or your ipod buds, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are any good.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Sony Sucks", "unixReviewTime": 1271030400, "reviewTime": "04 12, 2010"}

I have tried the Sony MDR-V6s (bought a pair and gave them away... couldn't stand them), some expensive Shure in-ear headphones (I felt like my ears were going to bleed after wearing them), and some Sony MDR-7506s.In the end, the V600s work the best for me (so far). They have great sound reproduction, I can wear them for hours at a time (and I'm super sensitive... I could wear the V6s for about 1 hour a day before I had to take them off), and they are a great value.

He hit me back w/ a link to the MDR-V600 for $83.99 so i bought them. Now i see the price is over double that. I can definitely undertand why. They have a really great sound quality even at the 200 dollar price tag. The highs are crisp and the bass hits deep. I've used them soley for the past 3 years and wear them sometimes for up to 8 hours w/ very little discomfort & obviously taking breaks throughout. They are also extremely durable and made w/ heavy duty plastic, cordage & parts and can definitely take some hits and drops. The cord is also long enough to provided a great distance to move around and access other equipment around the studio. Considering how much i paid for them they were definitely a steal, but regardless they are some headphones i'll probably use for atleast 2 or 3 more years. I can certainly say these are some of the best headphones i've ever owned.

I bought them refurbished from Amazon.com at the time, and paid $70 for them (including shipping). Mind you, those were used, refurbished headphones, but they and their packaging looked like new and performed (and still perform) like new. I am baffled to see them being sold for $200 on Amazon now, even though their traditionally more expensive and higher quality siblings (the MDR-V6 and MDR7506) are offered for $130 and $100 less, respectively. If you were planning to spend the stated $200 on the Sony MDR-V600 headphones, do yourself a favor and try the MDR-V6 or MDR7506 instead.With that said, I love my V600s and have never regretted the purchase. The bass is subtle but still obviously present, while the highs can get painfully high when paired with my MacBook Pro (2012 model, which has a good on-board DAC in it). This is reflected in the advertised frequency range of 5-30,000 Hz, and it surprised me since in my experience, Sony headphones traditionally sound a bit heavy on the bass, and muffled. In comparison, these headphones produce super clear sound.Best of all, the V600s are *comfortable*! So much so that I can wear them for hours on end during study sessions and never get tired of wearing them. They work well with my old iPod Video (generation 5.5, 30GB) and different computers, which means the headphones don't use a lot of power.Verdict: if you can find these headphones for $60-70, it is a deal you should never pass up. I thought they sounded better and more accurate than a friend's AKG 702 (which was admittedly more comfortable and durable, but still). Those looking to spend $200 on headphones and are interested in the MDR-V600 should save themselves $100 and get the higher-quality V6 or MDR7506 instead.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent $70 headphones!", "unixReviewTime": 1355097600, "reviewTime": "12 10, 2012"}
